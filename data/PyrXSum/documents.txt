The 33-year-old, who won the Champions League with Inter Milan in 2010, was a free agent after leaving Galatasaray at the end of last season.The former Ajax, Real Madrid and Inter Milan has signed a one-year deal, the club said.Sneijder played in the 2010 World Cup final for the Netherlands and has won league titles in four countries.Nice finished third in Ligue 1 last season and face a two-legged play-off against Napoli later this month to qualify for the Champions League group stages.On Saturday they lost their opening league match of the season 1-0 to Saint-Etienne.
Under Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy asked the bureau to unclassify the message so it could be archived, "never to be seen again".He made the request in relation to an email about the 2012 attacks on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.But the FBI said it did not change the classification level.The email in question described reports in November 2012 that Libyan police were arresting suspects in the attack of two months earlier, which left Ambassador Christopher Stephens and three other Americans dead.Other interesting revelations from the newly released FBI documents include:The 100-page FBI document published on Monday says an unnamed FBI official was "pressured" in summer last year to change the classified Clinton email to unclassified.The official said he had received a call from a colleague - whose name is also redacted - at the FBI's International Operations Division.The colleague said he had been contacted by Mr Kennedy asking him to change the email's classification level in "exchange for a 'quid pro quo'".The State Department, the FBI document says, offered to "reciprocate by allowing the FBI to place more Agents in countries where they are presently forbidden".Mr Kennedy, according to the FBI documents, followed up on this matter at a subsequent meeting, spending 15 minutes attempting to influence the FBI to unclassify the Clinton email.He also pressed FBI assistant director of counterterrorism Michael Steinbach on the issue.Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said the revelation "bears all the signs of a cover-up".Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump tweeted: "Unbelievable."Mr Kennedy, who has spent more than four decades at the State Department, was already a lightning rod for Republican criticism.He oversaw both diplomatic security during the 2012 attacks in Benghazi and the records and IT departments during Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server.But State Department Deputy spokesman Mark Toner denied any wrongdoing by Mr Kennedy."Under Secretary Kennedy sought to understand the FBI's process for withholding certain information from public release," Mr Toner said."As has been reported, there have been discussions within the interagency on issues of classification."The email in question was among some 100 messages recovered from Mrs Clinton's private email server that the FBI would ultimately designate as classified.The FBI and State Department engaged in a review of the former secretary of state's emails as they were being made ready for public release.FBI Director James Comey concluded in his investigation Mrs Clinton had been "extremely careless" in handling the classified material.The scandal has fuelled the perception among many voters she is untrustworthy.The emails scandal relating to her private server is different from the messages that Wikileaks have been releasing recently.
Dufner shot a second successive seven-under-par round of 65 for a tournament record 36-hole total of 14 under par.Rickie Fowler shot six under for the day to move third and within one stroke of fellow American Daniel Summerhays, with Jordan Spieth still on six under.Scotland's Martin Laird is a stroke further back at five under par.Dufner, who began his second round on the 10th, holed from 176 yards at 18 as his approach to the back of the green rolled down the slope and into the cup for an eagle."We got two more rounds to go. We'll see how the course changes, if the wind picks up, gets running fast, it plays different. We'll just see," said the 40-year-old.World number six Spieth was one shot off the lead after an opening round of 66, but three bogeys on the front nine saw him drop to tied fourth.Meanwhile, world number one Dustin Johnson missed the cut at eight over par.
Adam Burton, 23, and a French tourist were caught posing naked on Wednesday by surveillance workers and were removed from the Unesco World Heritage site, Cusco police said.A police spokesman told the Press Association the pair were questioned over minor offences "against morality".The Foreign Office said it was in contact with the Peruvian authorities.It is understood the men have not been arrested or charged.A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are in contact with local authorities in Peru following an incident involving a British national in Machu Picchu."Surveillance was increased at Machu Picchu in March 2014 after nude photos and streaking became increasingly common at the site.The Machu Picchu citadel, built by the Inca Empire in the 15th Century, stands at 2,430m (7,972ft) above sea level.Hundreds of thousands of tourists visit the site, which is one of Peru's main tourist attractions, each year.In June, four tourists who posed naked on a mountain in Malaysia, including one Briton, were given jail sentences of three days for causing a public nuisance.
The Devon-based 31-year-old's last race was the World Championships in February where he finished in 16th place.Having been a sprinter, Swift entered the GB programme while at university in Bath in 2006 and won the British title in 2008, as well as silver at the World Junior Championships that year.He won his first senior race in January this year when he took gold at St Moritiz in the Europa Cup."I have loved every minute of the last 10 years representing Great Britain," said Swift in a statement.Media playback is not supported on this device"However, I feel I have now achieved everything I am capable of in the sport. I'm disappointed not to have made an Olympic Games but I am so proud of everything I have achieved and will have absolutely no regrets moving forward."There comes a time where real life sort of catches up with you, and I have to acknowledge that. I never came into the sport for money - I wanted to chase a dream, and I've lived that dream."From winning a race and hearing the national anthem at the birthplace of our sport, to being a test pilot at the Sochi Track in the lead up to the 2014 Winter Olympics, there are far too many memories to mention, all of which put a huge smile on my face."GB Skeleton Performance Director Andi Schmid said: "Swifty has been a fantastic servant to GB Skeleton over the past 10 years."He has had a hugely positive impact on his team-mates and coaches and the sport as a whole and we thank him for his significant contribution to the programme."

Scocco, 29, known as "Nacho", arrived on a two-and-a-half year deal in January for £3.2m as one of Gus Poyet's four transfer window signings.Although Sunderland avoided relegation the one-cap Argentina international failed to score in eight appearances, all of which came from the bench.The fee has been reported in Argentina to be around £2.1m.Scocco, who is returning for his third spell at the club having helped Newell's to success in the 2004 Apertura and 2013 Final championships, is expected to be presented to supporters in Rosario on Saturday.
The London Legacy Development Corporation - which manages the publicly-owned stadium - has been told to publish details of the move.London mayor Boris Johnson, who oversees the LLDC, says he is "perfectly happy" with the decision.West Ham say it will prevent them "securing the best deal for taxpayers".The club were awarded tenancy of the London 2012 stadium in 2013, and £272m has been spent to convert the site for use as a Premier League ground.West Ham have contributed £15m towards those costs, and will pay between £2m and £2.5m a year in rent. Last month a BBC documentary revealed that the club was having many of the running costs of the stadium paid for it by the taxpayer under the terms of the tenancy agreement.A coalition of 14 supporters' trusts from around the country submitted a Freedom of Information request to obtain that tenancy agreement and believe that the deal gives West Ham a competitive advantage.Manchester City pay council rent of about £4m a year for the Etihad Stadium, the construction of which was also initially funded by taxpayers, for the 2002 Commonwealth Games.It has been reported that Chelsea and Tottenham may have to pay between £11m and £15m a year to play at Wembley if they use the national stadium temporarily while they redevelop their grounds.West Ham have joined the LLDC in insisting that the rental deal should remain private for reasons of commercial confidentiality.Speaking at mayor's question time on Wednesday, Johnson said he is happy to have the details made public but believes that the deal remains the best available for the taxpayer."We did not want to put anything out that would impact on our ability to negotiate future contracts," Johnson said."But it should be a matter of public record and we should be very proud that we have got a Premier League football team in that stadium."The stadium has been a fantastic success. It is doing brilliantly and it is basically unlike any other Olympic Stadium around the world as it has a long-term viable future with Premier League football at the heart of the deal."There are Olympic stadiums around the world that are totally mothballed and don't have any real activation in them. Go to Athens, go to Beijing."We've got nothing to hide, we've got a very good rental agreement with West Ham and it's fantastic that we will not be spending any more public money on this."Under the terms of the deal West Ham have a 99-year deal as anchor tenants, and the LLDC says future profits will see a return to the taxpayer.A West Ham spokesman said: "West Ham United shares the mayor's view that our presence at the former Olympic Stadium guarantees it a viable and sustainable future."Our agreement will not only return hundreds of millions of pounds to the taxpayer, but will ensure that London's Olympic Stadium will not join the long list of other former Olympic stadiums that are rotting away through lack of use."The LLDC has stated its disappointment at the Information Commissioner's Office ruling as it believes it will damage its ability to secure the best deal for the taxpayer in future and we share those sentiments."The club are now working with the LLDC to decide the appropriate next step."
He said his election after a landslide win in May was "a historic moment", and pledged no reconciliation with those who had "committed violence".The retired field marshal overthrew President Mohammed Morsi last July.He has since been pursuing a crackdown on Mr Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, which urged a boycott of the elections.Liberal and secular activists, including the 6 April youth movement which was prominent in the 2011 revolution that ousted long-serving President Hosni Mubarak, also shunned the 26-28 May poll in protest at the curtailing of civil rights.Mr Sisi, 59, made no mention directly of the Muslim Brotherhood in a speech at a Cairo presidential palace late on Sunday.But he said there would be no reconciliation with anyone who had "blood on their hands".He said: "Defeating terrorism and achieving security is the top priority in our coming phase."There will be no acquiescence or laxity shown to those who resorted to violence."Mr Sisi was earlier sworn in for a four-year term at a ceremony shown live on television.He said: "Throughout its extended history over thousands of years, our country has never witnessed a democratic peaceful handover of power."Mr Sisi's victory came almost a year after he ousted Egypt's first freely elected president, Mohamed Morsi, following mass protests against his rule.At the swearing-in, the Supreme Constitutional Court deputy head, Maher Sami, said the ousting was not a coup, and that Mr Sisi had responded to the will of the people.Who is Egypt's new president?Profile: Abdul Fattah al-SisiIn the May elections, Mr Sisi secured 96.9% of the vote and his sole challenger, left-winger Hamdeen Sabahi, received only 3.1%. Turnout was less than 50%.Mr Sisi inherits a nation that is divided and weary, the BBC's Orla Guerin in the Egyptian capital reports.Experts warn that if he cannot deliver in the next year or two he could also face a mass revolt.One student, Israa Youssef, told Reuters: "Sisi has to do something in his first 100 days, people will watch closely and there might be another revolution. That's what people are like in this country."Mr Sisi faces an array of challenges, including fixing the economy, preventing further political crises and easing poverty.More than a quarter of Egyptians live below the poverty line. Mr Sisi has pledged to build 26 new tourist resorts, eight new airports and 22 industrial estates.He has promised to restore security in a country where attacks by Islamist militants have left hundreds of security personnel dead over the past 11 months.The militants have stepped up attacks in response to the crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and its allies, in which more than 1,400 people have been killed and 16,000 detained.Mr Morsi and other senior leaders of the Brotherhood, which has been designated a terrorist organisation, are standing trial on a series of charges. They strongly deny any wrongdoing.Critics fear Mr Sisi will continue to show little tolerance for dissent.
Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe bronze figure of the Northern Irishman, crafted by Dublin sculptor Paul Ferrier, was unveiled in front of racegoers at the course on Tuesday.McCoy, 42, rode 31 winners at the Festival, including two Gold Cups and three Champion Hurdle successes.His final victory came at his last appearance at the meeting in 2015."I can only say a huge thank you to Cheltenham," said the jockey commonly known as AP."It was 20 years this week when I won the Champion Hurdle and Gold Cup and I had my first ride here in 1994. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would have a statue put up in my honour."A lot of my friends say the statue has more personality than I have."I am very honoured. I can say a huge thanks to Paul Ferrier who did this as he has made it just like me."I feel very honoured and flattered by it."McCoy was BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2010 after his only-ever Grand National victory on Don't Push It.
The sign outside Chimes cafe in Machynlleth, Powys, says: "The more you weigh, the harder you are to kidnap! Stay safe. Eat cake!!"April, five, went missing on 1 October 2012 near her home, sparking the biggest search in UK history.The cafe's owner said the sign was not meant to be distasteful or offensive.She added the sign had been on "display for many weeks" and she had "only received one comment"."April Jones's family have been in here recently, when the sign was up, and have not said anything," she said.However, she admitted she could "appreciate how others would interpret the message", but believes those who have complained "have taken it the wrong way".Machynlleth resident, Angharad Penrhyn Jones, took to Twitter to say: "A sign outside a cafe in #Machynlleth: "The more you weigh, the harder it is to get kidnapped. Eat cake!" In view of #AprilJones, shocking."I went to talk to cafe owner and apparently the sign is 'humorous' and the kidnapping happened 'years ago', and I am being 'hypersensitive.'Author and former parliamentary candidate, Mike Parker, said: "I think the sign is totally inappropriate and my first thought was how distasteful it was considering what had happened previously in the town".The cafe is situated behind the landmark clock tower in Machynlleth, which played a prominent visual role during the search for April when a large pink ribbon was placed on the railings outside.Mark Bridger, 47, of Ceinws, Powys, was found guilty of abducting and murdering April in a sexually motivated attack and must spend the rest of his life behind bars.Her remains have never been found.
Both blasts went off on Thika road, a busy highway north-east of the city.The buses were crowded at the time of the explosions, which police said were caused by improvised devices.Sunday's attack was the second in Kenya in as many days. Recent violence has been blamed by the government on Somali Islamist group al-Shabab.According to reports, the two explosions went off outside a hotel and at an underpass not far from Kasarani, north-east of the capital.Kenya's National Disaster Operations Centre said 20 of those wounded were in a critical condition.The buses were badly damaged by the explosions. Television footage showed a gaping hole in one, while the doors and windows were blown out of the other.On Saturday, a grenade was thrown in a bus in the coastal city of Mombasa leaving four people dead and another 15 wounded. The bus had just travelled from Nairobi. There was a second blast near a beach-front hotel, but no-one was hurt.The al-Qaeda-linked group al-Shabab has launched a series of attacks against Kenyan targets in recent years in retaliation for Kenya's military involvement in Somalia since 2011.In September, at least 67 people were killed when al-Shabab fighters seized the upmarket Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi for four days.Kenya has vowed to halt attacks by militant Islamists and arrested some 2,000 people in the capital last month.
Firefighters were called to the scene in Craigton Place, Winchburgh, at about 01:30 after a wheelie bin was set on fire.The bin had been resting against the house, which caused the fire to take hold quickly.Firefighters swiftly extinguished the blaze, when it was discovered that a gas pipe had been damaged in the fire.Thirty homes in the area were evacuated, with 38 residents temporarily housed at a local community centre.They were eventually allowed to return home at about 06:30.'Young children'Police are treating the blaze as wilful fire-raising and appealed for information about the West Lothian incident.They are keen to trace anyone who may have seen someone in the area just before the bin was set alight.Det Con Adrian Wallis said: "This was a serious incident which could have had devastating consequences."It also resulted in the evacuation of over 30 people, including young children and elderly residents. This caused much alarm and upset to those who had to leave their homes in the middle of the night."Anyone who saw anything suspicious at around 01:00, or has any other information regarding this incident, is asked to contact us immediately."
The ventriloquist, who, with his puppet duck Orville became a staple of Saturday night TV in the 1980s, died last month aged 67.Mourners gathered at the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church in his hometown to pay their respects.The entertainer's fourth wife Sarah and her children attended the ceremony, alongside Coronation Street star Ken Morley and comedian Jimmy Cricket.A floral tribute from the Nolan sisters read: "For Keith, a great pro, fantastic talent, [and] a lovely man who will be sorely missed"Harris entertained generations of children with his sidekick Orville, a bright green duck who wore a nappy and spoke in a high-pitched voice.He also gave life to the popular puppet Cuddles the monkey, whose catchphrase was 'I Hate That Duck!'.At the height of his fame, he fronted The Keith Harris Show on BBC One and gave private performances at birthday parties for Prince William and his brother Harry, at the request of Diana, Princess of Wales.His 1982 single, Orville's Song, was a top five hit, selling more than 400,000 copies.Harris, who married four times and had three children, was first diagnosed with cancer in 2013 and became ill again in January.He died in hospital in Blackpool on 28 April.
Mr Marshall-Andrews told The Times he had jumped ship in light of the Brexit campaign and Labour's refusal to stand aside in the Richmond Park by-election.The QC and barrister was MP for Medway from 1997 to 2010.A Labour spokesman said: "Bob Marshall-Andrews has not been a member of the Labour Party for some years."Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said he was "coming over to the only party that is offering a credible opposition to a divisive Tory Brexit government".Mr Marshall-Andrews used to sit with the socialist group of Labour MPs alongside Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell.He pointed to last year's by-election in South West London as a key moment in his decision-making.That Richmond Park election saw the Conservatives and UKIP stand aside in order to avoid taking votes from Zac Goldsmith, while the Greens refused to put up a candidate to allow the Lib Dems a free run. Labour rejected calls to not put up a candidate."Faced with a common enemy on this historic issue there was an urgent requirement for a common strategy if not common sense. Labour rejected both and fielded a candidate," said Mr Marshall-Andrews.
In securing the top spot in Super League they ended their 91-year wait for a top-flight title.First-half tries from Zak Hardaker, Mike McMeeken and Jake Webster set them on their way despite scores from Ben Jones-Bishop and Mason Caton-Brown.Greg Eden ran in, Webster scored a second-half hat-trick and Hardaker went over again as Cas cruised to victory.The Tigers have been in scintillating form all season, recording 22 wins from their 26 league games so far to secure top spot with four games to play.Daryl Powell's side have scored almost 200 points more than anyone else in the league as well as having the tightest defence.The visitors set out at a ferocious pace and had the hosts rattled in the first few minutes, with Liam Finn putting the first points of the day on the board with a penalty.Hardaker went over for the Tigers' first score after a neat pass from Luke Gale before Jones-Bishop levelled the scores with Trinity's first try.Parity was short-lived as McMeeken showed super handling to touch down before Webster extended the lead after a superb break by Hardaker.Wakefield secured the final points of the half when Caton-Brown charged over to get his side back in the game.Danny Kirmond's try for Chris Chester's side stunned the hosts at the start of the second half as Wakefield moved within two, but they responded quickly through Greg Eden's 38th try of the season and Webster's second of the game after Max Jowitt had kicked out on the full.Webster went over twice more either side of Gale landing a drop-goal to put the match firmly out of Trinity's reach with just over 10 minutes to play.Jowitt went over for the visitors but, fittingly, Castleford had the final say as Hardaker touched down after a quick breakaway.BBC Sport's Matt NewsumThere will have been a sense of double sweetness for Cas as the triumph came against local rivals Wakefield, who twice relegated them in late-season encounters in 2004 and 2006.The silverware they lifted under the Jungle lights, cruelly dubbed 'The Hubcap' by some league fans, might not rival the big Grand Final prize but it is a reward for consistency - a hallmark of Castleford's play throughout 2017 with 22 wins and four defeats from their 26 Super League games so far.Cas have had 't'lane' rocking this season, with a team honed by head coach Daryl Powell scoring an impressive 142 tries with an open, attacking brand of rugby league befitting the old nickname 'Classy Cas'.Free-scoring winger Greg Eden and England half-back Luke Gale are the more obvious stand-out names, but the success has equally been built on largely unsung aspects such as Paul McShane's dynamic dummy-half play and the pack of ball-handling, hard-tackling forwards such as Grant Millington, Adam Milner and Mike McMeeken.The big challenge for Cas now is to achieve their full potential, taking their week-to-week consistency and applying it to the knock-out football that the play-off semi-finals will bring - in the race for an Old Trafford Grand Final appearance.Castleford coach Daryl Powell told Sky Sports:"It's fantastic. For us, a group of people who have worked so hard from pre-season all the way through to be in this position. Four games (are) left for us and we got the job done."It's just an awesome feeling. It's a good news story for rugby league, I think the people there, the supporters, have been awesome all year and the boys have been superb."That's what teams are about. Everyone has played their part. The boys are doing their job and it's crucial that you recognise that everyone has been a part of it. My coaching staff are unbelievable people, outstanding at what they do."Castleford: Hardaker, Minikin, Webster, Shenton, Eden, Roberts, Gale, Millington, McShane, Sene-Lefao, O. Holmes, McMeeken, Massey.Replacements: Lynch, Milner, Moors, Foster.Wakefield: Jowitt, Jones-Bishop, Lyne, Caton-Brown, B. Tupou, Miller, Finn, Fifita, Hadley, England, Ashurst, Kirmond, Arona.Replacements: Williams, Huby, Annakin, Hirst.
The vigilantes were celebrating a successful operation with the military against the Islamist militants.An improvised explosive device (IED) went off killing and injuring people gathered around the celebrations.Despite losing territory this year, Boko Haram still controls a few areas.The BBC's Nigeria correspondent Will Ross says although it seems to have been an accident, this tragedy highlights the danger that remains even after the jihadists have been flushed out of an area.African news updates"The vigilante group together with the military decided to go to villages in Marte local government [area] where there is preponderance of Boko Haram elements," MP Tahir Monguno told the BBC Hausa service."In the course of the operation they killed some Boko Haram insurgents and they confiscated their weapons," he said.But one of the vigilantes failed to disclose one of the IEDs picked up during the two-day mission and took it back to Monguno, about 135km (83 miles) north-east of the Borno state capital, Maiduguri."Because of the successes they recorded there was celebration galore," the MP said, with many people joining in.Ten people were killed instantaneously when the device exploded on Tuesday evening and another 13 people died by the time the injured were taken to Maiduguri, he said."Fifteen of them are [still] in the intensive care unit of the hospital," Mr Monguno said.Will new military HQ defeat Boko Haram?Why Boko Haram remains a threatA military source told the BBC that 12 people transported to Maiduguri had died but was unable to confirm the number of those who died in Monguno.Earlier, a witness told the Associated Press news agency that the device was found at an abandoned Boko Haram camp.According to Amnesty International, at least 17,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed since the group launched their violent uprising to impose Islamic rule in 2009.The group is still holding many women, girls and children captive, including 219 schoolgirls it kidnapped from a school in Chibok in April last year.With the help of Niger and Chad, Nigeria's military has been able to recapture most towns and villages taken by the group.Despite losing territory, the militants are still active in the north-east and Chad blames Boko Haram for two suicide attacks in its capital, N'Djamena on Monday.
But the music in the air is understated these days. Birdsong and the chatter of children have replaced the loud clang and clatter of heavy industry.It is not the hush of contentment, but the quiet of an industrial graveyard.A council leader warns of history repeating itself. A local activist urges the people of Wales to show heart and spirit and fight back.The message to Port Talbot from Ravenscraig is blunt: don't let this happen to you.Ravenscraig steelworks in central Scotland closed in 1992 after a bitter 12-year fight.There is still a numbness here, the pain of a phantom limb still nearly unbearable almost a quarter of a century after amputation.The questions it raises - about the UK's industrial strategy and the way areas are treated when their main source of employment disappears - are still raw.Listen to Mark Mardell's full report from Ravenscraig on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend.Workers were given generous compensation and retrained, according to one union leader, but the promised regeneration never came.The 'Craig, as everyone around here calls it with familiar affection, covered an area twice the size of Monaco. Today it is largely a wasteland, the biggest brownfield site in Europe.Very brown it is too. Sure there is a gleaming glass-fronted further education college, a sports centre of dramatic design, a pub and some new homes. But there are also swathes of churned up mud, puddles and scrubby grass.There were ambitious plans for the biggest new town in Europe and an immense shopping centre that would pull in people from all over Scotland. But other retailers didn't like the idea and there was a lengthy court battle that went to the House of Lords.By the time it was over, the recession and the new enthusiasm for shopping online put paid to those dreams.Everyone I talk to speaks as if with one mind. If regeneration is to happen it should be well-funded and immediate. But it is not the answer. The answer is "save our steel".What happened to the people of Ravenscraig - what they fear awaits families in Port Talbot - goes to the heart of a problem that haunts the West and reverberates in its politics.It is one part of the reason for the success of Donald Trump in the US and parties of the hard right and hard left in Europe, as well as the plight of the Labour Party in many parts of the UK.While globalisation may boost the world economy, while its masters feel as at home in Beijing, Birmingham and Berlin, it leaves a remnant floundering in a changing landscape, searching for more secure national identities rooted in a tried and tested past.It explains why we are hearing calls for trade tariffs when once protectionism seemed as old-fashioned as the intense battle over the Corn Laws.Steelworks, like coal mining and shipbuilding, were the source of jobs for generations and decent money. But my visit to Ravenscraig reminded me that it was about more than just cash.I started my life as a journalist on Teesside in the north east of England at the time when closures were always in the air. It seemed each week the Labour MPs would come up with a new "dossier of despair" chronicling decline.Not much has changed - Redcar's steelworks finally shut down last autumn.Later as an industrial reporter I covered the long and bitter miners' strike.The sector, hit by multiple mass extinctions, not only underpinned a region's economy but was a source of pride and purpose. The sort of feeling that people have for their country or their football team, people had for their industry, their plant, their pit.Maybe that's an overly romantic generalisation but there's a truth in it.You don't get that sense of self worth from a call centre or a food court. Nor do you get the power of the unions or a solid commitment to one political party.This is a phenomenon all over Europe and the US. The Rust Belt in the US goes on for mile after mile, rows of corroding chimneys and towers, inspiring Bruce Springsteen's despairing nostalgia for blue collar America.You can see similar discarded husks of heavy industry all over Eastern Europe.But there is a particularly British twist to this story. I remember going to see the heartland of German industry, the Ruhr, six or seven years ago.Mining is dead but steel is very much alive. Standing high up in a steelworks command centre, like the bridge of a ship, you can look down on an area much bigger than Ravenscraig, pumping out smoke and steam.Germany has a strategy that values manufacturing.The SNP government in Scotland would say it does too. When Tata announced the planned closure of the last remaining steelworks, they acted. Details of the deal are sketchy, but it appears the plants were nationalised for a few brief hours and then sold on.It is not just industrial giants Germany and the US who produce more steel than the UK. So do France, Italy and Spain.Perhaps, some would argue, that is because they are behind the times. But the question is obvious - if I have been covering the decline of British steel all my working life, what have successive British governments been doing about it?At Ravenscraig you'll hear mutterings about "Maggie" and "the Conservatives". But it is arguable that all recent governments have seen heavy industry as the past, and banking and services as the bright future - the market embraced with an enthusiasm not matched on the continent.This current steel crisis will pass, one way or another. But it provokes big questions, not only about whether steel is a strategic resource, but about the future of work. That does not mean it will result in a new strategy or new thinking.But this leaves a sense of bitterness in its wake. As one man who worked at the 'Craig for 30 years put it: "You still need steel. You can't make the Forth Bridge out of plastic."

The Uefa general secretary has included the plan in his manifesto for the Fifa election on 26 February.His idea follows European football's governing body Uefa's decision to play Euro 2020 in 13 different countries."Each confederation shall have to wait at least two editions before being able to host the World Cup again," he said."This will ensure a more equitable rotation, while giving every confederation the opportunity to organise this unique event."Furthermore, Fifa should investigate the possibility of organising the World Cup not only in one or two countries but in a whole region, so enabling several countries to enjoy the honour and benefits of hosting the World Cup."Infantino is one of five candidates standing for the presidency of world football's governing body, which is in crisis following a series of corruption claims.He is up against Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, the Bahraini head of the Asian football confederation (AFC), Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan, South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale and Jerome Champagne, a former Fifa deputy secretary general from France.Current Fifa president Sepp Blatter has been banned for eight years from all football-related activities for breaching ethics rules.
Mr Swinney said the UK government's recent spending review placed "unprecedented pressure" on public expenditure north of the border.The UK government said Scottish ministers would have £390m more in spending available to them next year.Mr Swinney is due to present his 2016-17 spending plans on Wednesday.The Scottish government argues that cuts imposed by the UK government since 2010 - along with last month's spending review - mean that its discretionary budget will be 12.5% lower in real terms by 2019-20 than it was in 2010-11.Mr Swinney said 4.2% of that reduction would come between now and 2019-20.He said: "The chancellor (George Osborne) has imposed real terms cuts on Scotland every year from now until 2020, and more than £1bn of those cuts are still to come between now and the end of the decade."We have demonstrated that the UK government didn't have to take this approach. Debt and the deficit could have been reduced without this scale of cuts that has been chosen by the chancellor."Now Scotland has to deal with the reality of the chancellor's decision. We face tough choices in the coming days."Against this backdrop, the Scottish government is determined that we will defend and protect the key priorities that the people of Scotland expect us to deliver on."Mr Swinney said schools, hospitals and the police service in Scotland would "not be sacrificed to the chancellor's austerity obsession".He added: "In recent years we have been able to deliver better outcomes for the people of Scotland. More police, lower crime, better schools, tuition-free university education and a health budget that is at a record level."These commitments demonstrate the prioritisation of the Scottish government."Responding to Mr Swinney comments, a spokesman for the UK government's Scotland Office said: "The Scottish government will have £390m more spending available to it next year, which rises to £750m if you include its own underspend."The stability of the UK economy means the block grant will be almost £30bn."One look at the current oil price tells you this is a much better deal for people in Scotland than the constitutional alternative favoured by the Scottish government."The Scottish government should perhaps focus more on gearing up for its new powers and getting the best for Scotland, rather than grievance."Labour's public services spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: "Ahead of the most important budget since devolution, it's time John Swinney backed up his anti-austerity posturing with something real."Telling us about pre-election giveaways now and cuts later isn't good enough. This needs to be a long-term budget."Scotland needs a government that spends less time congratulating itself on its spin and more time explaining its record."Scottish Labour will offer a real alternative to austerity, with different decisions on tax to the Tories, and different decisions on tax to the SNP."
Sir Martin Moore-Bick sent the letter late on Thursday following weeks of discussion with survivors.There has been controversy over Sir Martin's suitability for the role and the areas the inquiry will cover.The prime minister will set out the terms of reference for the process in the coming weeks.Downing Street said: "The prime minister has received the letter and will consider it and respond shortly."How far the inquiry can go has been a source of controversy since the Sir Martin's appointment was announced.He angered survivors on his first day in the job by indicating the investigation would be "pretty well limited" to examining the cause of the fire, how it spread and how to prevent future incidents.But he later vowed to consider a "broad range of evidence" which could include why residents' warnings about fire safety were allegedly ignored by authorities.Survivors, bereaved families and other involved parties spent weeks making their case about what questions the inquiry should answer.More than 400 submissions were received during the consultation period.The "Justice 4 Grenfell" campaign said earlier this month it wanted an examination of local and national social housing policy and whether it "increased risks to residents".Questions were raised in the aftermath of the disaster about the cladding used on Grenfell and other buildings. More than 100 buildings have failed the latest fire safety tests set in the wake of the fire.Sir Martin has previously faced calls to resign from residents, while Labour MP David Lammy said he was a "white, upper-middle class man" who had "never" visited a tower block housing estate and should not have been appointed.The inquiry is due to start in September. Sir Martin has previously said an interim report could be produced within a year.The prime minister will set out the terms of reference for the process in the coming weeks.
In Palmer on Thursday, at about 03:00 an officer told Karen and Jay Priest their son Justin, 29, had been killed.The devastated couple drove to Justin Priest's girlfriend's home to inform her, when he greeted them at the door.In fact, another man with the same name but different birthday was killed. The Juneau police apologised for the error.After hearing the horrible news, the Priests telephoned far-away relatives, then drove to Anchorage to tell their other son in person, they told Alaska Dispatch News.Then, the grieving family set out to inform Justin's girlfriend of five years.At her home at about 05:30, Justin Priest said he heard a knock on the door as he was getting ready to walk his dog. Still bleary-eyed from sleep, he was surprised to see his family. All erupted with joy, praising Jesus and embracing one another in tears."It opens and right here is Justin. I don't even see it but Jay is sobbing. It doesn't compute to me. Then I see him," Mrs Priest told the Associated Press news agency. "You want it to be true, but you go, 'Am I hallucinating?' Justin didn't know what was going on."The Juneau police have apologised for the anguish, however momentary.Justin Priest told the Alaska Dispatch that the family's relief and joy is tempered by the awareness another family lost a son.
Last month, Pistorius began serving a five year prison sentence for the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp, although he could be out in 10 months.The sentence failed to consider the "horrendous manner" in which Ms Steenkamp was killed, prosecutors said.Prosecutors are also appealing against Pistorius' murder acquittal.The double-amputee Olympic sprinter was charged by the prosecution with the pre-meditated murder of Ms Steenkamp, a model and law graduate who was his girlfriend.He was acquitted of this and the lesser murder charge of dolus eventualis by High Court Judge Thokozile Masipa on 21 October.In South African law, this charge - also known as common-law murder - applies if the accused knew they might kill someone but still went ahead with their course of action."The appeal on conviction is based on the question of law," said National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Nathi Mncube in a statement.In papers filed with the North Gauteng High Court and published by South Africa's Eyewitness News on its website, prosecutor Gerrie Nel said Judge Masipa "erred in over-emphasising the personal circumstances of the accused and the fact that the accused was suffering from post-traumatic stress, was anxious and 'seems remorseful'."Not enough emphasis was placed on the horrendous manner in which the deceased died coupled with the gruesome injuries she sustained when the accused shot and killed her," he said.Pistorius' sentence was "shockingly light, inappropriate and would not have been imposed by any reasonable court", Mr Nel added.The judge failed to sufficiently consider that Pistorius acted with "gross negligence", and had fired four shots with a gun "loaded with black talon ammunition through a locked door into a small toilet cubicle from which there was no room to escape".The prosecution had called for him to be given the maximum 15-year sentence for culpable homicide, or manslaughter.Ms Steenkamp was killed at Pistorius' upmarket home in the capital, Pretoria, in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year.He said he feared there was an intruder but he did not intend to kill.Mr Mncube said the application for permission to appeal was expected to be considered by Judge Masipa."If it's granted, the case will then be heard by the Supreme Court of  Appeal," Mr Mncube is quoted by AFP news agency as saying.Prosecutors had the option to petition the Supreme Court to hear the case if permission was refused, Mr Mncube said.The athlete was also given a three-year suspended sentence for firing a gun in a restaurant.Pistorius is currently serving his sentence in the hospital section of Pretoria's Kgosi Mampuru II jail.He can apply to serve the rest of his sentence under house arrest after 10 months in prison.After the verdict, his family said that he would not appeal.Inside Oscar Pistorius's home12354Mr Pistorius said he and Ms Steenkamp had dinner at about 19:00 before going to bed at 21:00. He said he woke in the early hours, spoke briefly to his girlfriend and got up to close the sliding door and curtains.Judge Thokozile Masipa questioned the reliability of several witnesses who said they heard screams and gunshots between about 03:12 and 03:17, saying most had 'got facts wrong'.Mr Pistorius said he heard the bathroom window sliding open and believed that an intruder, or intruders, had entered the bathroom through a window which was not fitted with burglar bars.Mr Pistorius said he grabbed his firearm and told Ms Steenkamp, who he thought was still in bed, to call the police.The judge said it made no sense that Ms Steenkamp did not hear him scream 'Get out' or call the police, as she had her mobile phone with her.Mr Pistorius could see the bathroom window was open and toilet door closed. He said he did not know whether the intruders were outside on a ladder or in the toilet.He had his firearm in front of him, he heard a movement inside the toilet and thought whoever was inside was coming out to attack him.'Before I knew it, I had fired four shots at the door,' he said.The judge said she did not accept that Mr Pistorius fired the gun by accident or before he knew what was happening. She said he had armed himself with a lethal weapon and clearly wanted to use it. The other question, she said, was why he fired not one, but four shots before he ran back to the room to try to find Ms Steenkamp.Mr Pistorius said he went back to the bedroom and noticed that Ms Steenkamp was not there.Mr Pistorius said this was when he realised she could have been in the toilet and rushed back to the bathroom.Mr Pistorius said he screamed for help and went back to the bathroom where he found the toilet was locked. He returned to the bedroom, pulled on his prosthetic legs and turned on the lights before bashing in the toilet door with a cricket bat.When the door panel broke, he found the key and unlocked the door and found Ms Steenkamp slumped on the floor with her head on the toilet bowl. He then carried her downstairs, where he was met by neighbours.3D animation of the apartment
It will provide extra antenatal support with specially-trained midwives, psychologists and paediatricians.Co-run by Barts Health NHS Trust in London, the scheme could be introduced in other UK hospitals if successful.Consultant midwife Inderjeet Kaur said the extra care was "so important" as giving birth could trigger frightening, graphic memories of an attack.One in five women between the ages of 16-59 in England and Wales has experienced some form of sexual violence, according to official statistics.BBC News spoke to three rape victims about their experiences during childbirth - two of them helped design how the clinic would operate.Melanie (name changed for confidentiality), aged 37, had her baby two years ago.She said: "I was given gas and air whilst in labour and I started hallucinating, seeing the man who had attacked me in the room. I managed to articulate what was happening to my husband, but he didn't know what to do."He wasn't equipped to deal with it at all, and there was no-one else in the room who was either. I was terrified and screaming. Nobody asked me; I wish I'd had some control."'I cried and cried hysterically': Three women describe their traumatic experiencesThough the service will be integrated into a regular maternity ward at the Royal London Hospital, women will follow a different antenatal route from the moment they are referred.As well as being offered extra, longer meetings with specially-trained staff, women will be able to have more of a say as to how their birthing rooms are laid out and legal advice over their medical checks.The clinic will also provide antenatal classes and breastfeeding advice which has been altered for women who have experienced sexual attacks, and offer specialist gynaecological examinations and mental health support after labour.It also plans to offer women in other countries one-off appointments in the form of video calls.Pavan Amara, founder of the My Body Back project which jointly established the clinic with the Barts Health NHS Trust, has met a number of women who told her of traumatic experiences during their pregnancies.She said: "One woman was told by her rapist: 'If you relax it'll be over with quicker.'When the woman was told the same thing in a healthcare setting, "the health professional was completely unwittingly and unknowingly echoing the words of the rapist"."It had a huge impact on the woman mentally. It's things like this... very small, but very big for a woman who is vulnerable."Women can self-refer to the maternity clinic by emailing the team to make an appointment.Ms Amara explained: "They don't have to say what happened, although they can if they want to. Whatever they feel is right for them. We will then book them an appointment and take it from there."She said support for women in other countries would be conducted out-of-hours in the team's own spare time.The team had received many international emails from women who cannot use NHS services, she said, adding: "We don't want to leave them with no option, we want to do something for them."Ms Amara, who was raped as a teenager, waived her anonymity as a victim when she helped set up a sexual health clinic at the hospital for victims of sexual violence last August. With more than 800 women using the service since it was set up, talks are under way to open a similar unit in Glasgow.One rape victim explained how her body "went into complete shock" when she went into labour."I just couldn't open my legs for the baby to come out," she said."There was an emergency so they took me straight down to the operating theatre. It was very noisy and it was very busy."There were bright lights and just lots and lots of people around. And, I think for me, because there had been lots of people there in my rape and lots of people watching what was going on, it just brought back so many memories."It was very traumatising."The victim, who wished to remain anonymous, believes the new clinic will help others."Just by virtue of walking through the door, people know something of what's happened to you. So you've said it without saying it which is often the hardest thing," she said.Consultant midwife at the clinic Inderjeet Kaur said often women did not want to talk about what had happened to them.This could mean medical staff are unhelpful without even realising it, for example by using the wrong language."This is so important because these women are so vulnerable - we shouldn't be contributing to their trauma," she said.
The details were revealed after a five-year-old Nottinghamshire boy recently returned to the classroom as a girl.The Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) said 969 under-18s have been referred in the UK in 2015-16, including nearly 200 aged 12 or under.This compares to just 94 in 2009-2010.*2015-16 figures, available for April-Dec onlyThe statistics also showed one three-year old and three four-year-olds were referred to GIDS since April last year.In the Nottinghamshire case, letters were sent to classmates and parents at the start of the current term explaining the five-year-old's wishes to be treated as a girl.Her family told the Nottingham Post the decision was not taken lightly and they had received support.Nottinghamshire County Council admitted transgender issues were a new area for many schools but said it "supported head teachers on a range of equality issues".Colin Pettigrew, the authority's director for children, families and cultural services, said: "Transgender is a characteristic protected by law and therefore head teachers across England continue to, and are required to, agree a clear plan to support the needs of transgender children and young people."Updates on this story and more from NottinghamshireGIDS, based in north London, is the NHS's dedicated gender identity development service for children and takes referrals from GPs, paediatricians, mental health services and schools across the country.Its director, Polly Carmichael, said in recent years more younger children were making gender transitions and there was no "right or wrong approach", with many families reporting their child was happier living in another gender.However, she said research published in the Netherlands suggested that "for some young people who make an early social transition it may be difficult to de-transition if their gender identity develops in another direction".In terms of the general increase in referrals, GIDS said there could be a number of reasons, but increased awareness and acceptance of gender issues - particularly via the media and social networks - was a likely factor.Whatever age a child is referred, no physical changes can be made until the young person is in puberty, it said.Bernard Reed from the Gender Identity Research and Education Society (GIRES)  - a charity which works to improve the lives of gender non-conforming people - said many young people still did not feel confident speaking about gender issues."There are several hundred cases each year and they are quite often referred for medical support" he said."But because society is often not supportive in such cases, usually these young people do not seek publicity".
At the Election Court - part of the High Court - in London, four voters alleged mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman had committed electoral fraud.Independent Mr Rahman was elected for a second term in May 2014. His lawyer said the claims were a "mixture of unfounded and false allegations".The group of voters wants the poll declared void and rerun.Evidence is to be outlined to Election Commissioner Richard Mawrey - a senior lawyer sitting as a judge - over a number of weeks.The group of voters mounted the challenge under the provisions of the 1983 Representation Of The People Act.Andy Erlam, who stood as a councillor on an anti-corruption ticket and is heading the group, said there were "serious questions" which "need answers".Francis Hoar, representing the group of four, told Mr Mawrey his clients were accusing Mr Rahman of election fraud.He said there had been "personation" - where people pretend to be someone else to cast a vote - in postal voting and at polling stations.He added people had registered themselves or others to vote at addresses at which they did not live and there had been tampering with ballot papers.Mr Hoar also alleged Mr Rahman had used "undue influence through intimidation at polling stations" and "interference with voters" - including in polling booths.The court heard one presiding officer reported there was a "constant battle" to stop men entering polling booths with women and telling them how to vote.He said there had been "bribery" through "unlawfully diverting public funds to organisations in order corruptly to procure their political support".Mr Hoar told Mr Mawrey that his clients aimed to call almost 100 witnesses who "know about corruption" and "know about Lutfur Rahman".Mr Mawrey told the court that, if he found allegations had been proved, he could declare the election "void" and rule that Mr Rahman had not been declared mayor.Allegations against returning officer John Williams have been withdrawn by lawyers for the group, the court was told.Timothy Straker QC, for Mr Williams, said it had been accepted his client had "acted properly throughout the election".Mr Williams said, outside court, in a statement: "This was a hotly contested election run in challenging circumstances."As returning officer I am politically neutral and my only concern is to run an efficient, free and fair election."Duncan Penny QC, for Mr Rahman, described the petition as "a rich and elaborate mixture of unfounded and false allegations" and its one aim was to unseat a directly elected mayor.He told the court: "There is little, if any evidence, of personal wrongdoing by Lutfur Rahman" and described the group's claims as "invention" and "exaggeration".He said Mr Rahman did not want to be elected as a result of fraudulent activity and had been anxious that electoral law was observed.Mr Penny said: "He has consistently called for anyone with suspicion of malpractice to report them and has been a public proponent of reforms to the postal voting system."The hearing continues.
Mr Haugh, 25, was stabbed in a laneway in the Marian estate in the early hours of Sunday.Robbie Walsh, of Island View, Kilrush, was charged with assault causing serious harm to Mr Haugh.He has been remanded in custody to appear again in court next week.Two other men arrested over the killing were released without charge, with files being prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions.At Ennis District Court on Tuesday, Det Sgt Padraig Frawley said it will be alleged that Mr Walsh was one of three people who entered the Marian Estate in Kilkee shortly after 01:00 on Sunday and called to houses in the estate looking for Mr Haugh.Det Frawley said it will be further alleged that while in the estate, the accused and the two males came across Mr Haugh and another man and a fight ensued where weapons were used.He said: "Other individuals also arrived who became involved in the fight."Det Frawley said: "During the course of the altercation, Karl Haugh received a stab wound to his back. Garda arrived at the scene where knives and golf clubs were recovered."He said that Mr Haugh was brought by ambulance to Limerick University Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 06:00 local time.He said police recovered a knife handle and a blade at the scene of Mr Haugh's death and the blade had blood on it.A judge said the state had given evidence of tension in the area of Kilkee as a result of the killing and remanded Mr Walsh in custody until 14 August.
The Communication Workers Union said the walkout would start on Monday 19 December and include Christmas Eve.It will involve thousands of workers from the Crown Post Offices.The Post Office said despite the walkout it would be "business as usual" with "at least" 97% of its 11,600 branches not involved.Crown Post Offices are the larger branches that are usually located in High Streets.In April 2016, the Post Office announced plans to transfer up to 61 branches into WH Smith stores over the following year.It said the move was part of a 10-year plan to cut costs and save cash, and would act as a way of "safeguarding the future of the network.""Our members want the Post Office management to pause its closure and privatisation programme, hold off on its planned pensions changes, and commit to sitting down with us and with the other key stakeholders of this Great British institution and, together, construct a lasting vision," said CWU assistant secretary Andy Furey.The Post Office said it was "extremely disappointed" by the CWU's action."Just today, we agreed with the CWU that we would resume talks, which have been ongoing throughout the summer, on Wednesday," added Kevin Gilliland, the Post Office's network and sales director.
The body will also be responsible for the registration and regulation of youth support workers and work-based learning practitioners.They join more than 75,000 school and further education teachers and learning support staff on the national register.The council's chief executive Hayden Llewellyn said regulating all these groups was a "world-first for Wales".He added it was "a bold and welcome step"."By bringing non-formal and in-work education in line with formal education, we are enhancing the status of the often overlooked professions of youth work and work-based learning and the increasingly important role they play in young people's wellbeing and education," Mr Llewellyn said.Keith Towler, chairman of CWVYS (Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services), said good quality youth work "saves young lives"."The trusted relationship between young people and youth workers and youth support workers is vital for the development of resilience, self-esteem and delivery of professional responses to a huge range of issues," Mr Towler said."Recognition of informal and non-formal learning in a wider educational context is important and this will support the development of quality youth work provision."Julie James, minister for skills and science, said the new registration system "supports our ambition to achieve the highest possible professional standards throughout the whole education sector and it will provide a vital component in ensuring the people of Wales receive high quality learning throughout their lives".
Mr Farron said political leaders should not "pontificate on theological matters".But he said it had become "an issue" and that he wanted the focus to be on the general election.He has recently been asked repeatedly in media interviews to clarify his views, but had not answered directly.In an interview with BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier, he said he did not "want to get into a series of questions unpicking the theology of the Bible".But he acknowledged it had "become an issue", and did not want people getting the "wrong impression" about his views."I don't believe that gay sex is a sin," he said."I take the view though that as a political leader, my job is not to pontificate on theological matters."Mr Farron said that with a general election campaign under way, it was important to be talking about "big issues" like health and social care and Brexit."I am quite careful about how I talk about my faith. I do not bang on about it, I do not make a secret out of it," he said."On reflection, it makes sense to actually answer this direct question since it's become an issue."He also said the Lib Dems had "undoubtedly the best record" on gay rights out of all political parties.As well as questions from the media about his views on gay sex, Mr Farron was also asked last week by Conservative MP Nigel Evans in Parliament whether he believed being gay was a sin."I do not," he replied.Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning

Media playback is not supported on this deviceMignolet struggled as the Reds twice gave away the lead in a thrilling 3-3 draw with the Premier League leaders."For the second goal he needs help from all the players," said Klopp, in reference to Mignolet scrambling as Olivier Giroud scored from a corner.The Belgium goalkeeper, 27, is set to sign a new five-year contract.Mignolet, who joined the Reds from Sunderland in a £9m deal in June 2013, was also beaten at his near post by Aaron Ramsey for Arsenal's first equaliser.Klopp, who has consistently backed Mignolet, added: "On the second goal, on a perfect day he can make a save but there were a lot of mistakes before."We have to defend this better."Liverpool's goalkeeping weaknesses have been exposed by errors from Mignolet's deputy Adam Bogdan in the 3-0 defeat at Watford and the 2-2 FA Cup draw at Exeter.That has prompted Klopp to recall 22-year-old Welshman Danny Ward, a substitute on Wednesday, from a successful loan spell at Aberdeen.Liverpool snatched a deserved draw with Arsenal thanks to Joe Allen's late equaliser.Roberto Firmino twice gave Liverpool the lead in a breathless first half, the second a spectacular 20-yard drive, but Arsenal levelled through Ramsey and Giroud.Giroud's second-half strike - his 18th goal of the season - looked to have put the Gunners on course for a crucial victory, but substitute Allen rewarded the hosts for a display bursting with energy and spirit with a low 90th-minute finish.Media playback is not supported on this deviceKlopp was delighted with the performance of Brazil forward Firmino, who has struggled to live up to his £29m transfer fee since arriving from Hoffenheim in the summer.The German said: "I could talk about this for half an hour. He doesn't know how good he is. If you are good, you have to show it."He had a really good game but he was not the only one. I could talk about special performances - we had a lot of other players."Klopp was also involved in an angry first-half exchange with fourth official Robert Madley and was calmed down, amiably, by his opposite number Arsene Wenger.He said: "I told Arsene why I was a little bit emotional. It was a clear throw-in for us in a good moment, a good phase. I said what I said, he said what he said."We had nothing, it was friendly."
Most are being transported to rebel-held Idlib province, where aid groups say conditions are inadequate, with insufficient food and medical supplies.The International Committee of the Red Cross, whose staff are assisting the operation, said on Tuesday that 25,000 rebel fighters and civilians had been evacuated since the operation got under way.As many as 25,000 others could be waiting to leave in freezing conditions.Last Thursday, UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura estimated that some 50,000 people, among them 40,000 civilians, were trapped inside the four of five districts still under rebel control, which together cover about 2.6 sq km (1 sq mile).As part of the ceasefire deal, 750 people have been evacuated simultaneously from two Shia towns in Idlib province that are under siege by rebel forces - Foah and Kefraya.The UN Security Council has meanwhile approved the deployment of 20 observers to Aleppo to monitor the treatment of civilians as pro-government forces assume complete control of the rebel enclave.More than 70,000 people have also fled on foot to government-controlled areas since mid-November, when government forces stepped up their assault.The UN said on Tuesday that its aid partners had counted 19,000 evacuees arriving in Idlib province, a rebel stronghold. Many have been taken to temporary camps while others have found shelter with relatives.The World Health Organization separately said on Tuesday that 301 injured and sick patients, including 67 children, had been taken by ambulances to eight different hospitals in the western Aleppo countryside and Idlib province.The WHO says 93 patients had subsequently been referred to hospitals in Turkey, which backs the rebels and helped negotiate the ceasefire deal with Russia.Turkey, which is home to some 2.7 million Syrian refugees, is also preparing to set up a "tent city" in Idlib to accommodate up to 80,000 displaced people from Aleppo.Three possible sites have reportedly been identified, and hundreds of aid lorries from the Turkish Red Crescent and the Humanitarian Relief Foundation (IHH) charity have crossed the border.A smaller camp for 1,000 "disadvantaged" evacuees from Aleppo - the injured and disabled - will be set up in the Turkish border town of Reyhanli.In many places, conditions are already inadequate, with families staying in crowded buildings still under construction with no heat, toilets or running water, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) says. And villages in the countryside are said to be getting full.A doctor who is volunteering at a makeshift hospital in Idlib said there was no equipment to monitor patients. "Even the Intensive Care Unit doesn't have a ventilator," he said in a video posted on Facebook.Idlib already hosts some 230,000 displaced people in and around 250 informal camps, according to the IRC.Aid agencies have raised concerns over the security of those in Idlib.Most of the province is controlled by a powerful rebel alliance that includes the jihadist group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, which was known as al-Nusra Front until it announced it was breaking off formal ties with al-Qaeda in July 2016.The province has been repeatedly bombed by the Syrian and Russian air forces, and President Bashar al-Assad has said it will be one of the next areas to be "liberated" after Aleppo.Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy, warned on Friday: "If there is no political agreement and a ceasefire, Idlib will become the next Aleppo."Some 20,000 people are living in the two predominantly Shia towns, located just to the north of the city of Idlib, which have been under siege by rebel and jihadist fighters since March 2015.Pro-government fighters who were evacuated a year ago reported that starving residents had resorted to eating grass, and that injured people had undergone surgery without anaesthesia.The fates of the residents of Foah and Kefraya have previously been tied to those living in two mainly Sunni towns besieged by pro-government forces outside Damascus - Zabadani and Madaya.Several simultaneous evacuations from the four towns have taken place, while limited deliveries of food and medical aid were permitted three times this year.
A Monitor report published in February called for the closure of acute services including the A&E department.The trust that runs the hospital was put into administration by the health regulator Monitor on Monday.Support Stafford Hospital campaigners and police said up to 30,000 people had joined the mile-long march, from the town centre to the hospital.The campaign group said the town's Market Square was so full of protesters it took 45 minutes for it to clear after the march started at about 1400 BST.Thousands of people had previously signed a petition calling for Stafford Hospital's services to remain and a campaign shop from the protest group has been set up in the town centre.By Chris KingBBC Radio StokeFor the past four years the name "Stafford Hospital" has been a byword for everything that is bad about the NHS.Today, 30,000 people turned out with their banners and placards to send out the message that they believe their hospital is now safe, and they are prepared to fight for its future.The special administrators were not there today but they will find it hard to ignore the views of so many people.Last week they told me that they were starting with a blank sheet of paper when it came to the future of services at the Mid Staffordshire Trust. This afternoon the people of Stafford gave them a clear indication of what they'd like them to write on it.Jean Tabarner, one of the marchers, said she had had cancer and that Stafford Hospital had saved her life.She said: "We've got to try - if you don't try, no-one will listen. We've got to keep plugging away and hope that the administrators listen to what the people around here want."Sue Hawkins, chair of the Support Stafford Hospital group, said she believed it was important for people to move on from what had happened in the past at the hospital.She said: "We've got a safe hospital today and we're looking to the future."She added: "We need to have an intensive care unit here, we need to have an accident and emergency 24 hours a day and we believe that's possible."We know there have to be changes, we know there may have to be some alliance with another hospital to achieve that."Stafford Borough Council leader Mike Heenan, who joined the marchers, said: "The important thing is delivering services locally, for the local people."That's what we're fighting for - so that acute services can stay in Stafford."Monitor has given the administrators for the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, Ernst and Young, 145 days to work with local healthcare organisations to produce a "sustainable plan" for the future of services at the Stafford and Cannock Chase hospitals.The Contingency Planning Team (CPT) report to Monitor last month said staffing levels at the hospitals were not sufficient to meet required standards in the long term, given the current range of services and number of patients.It said some services, including accident and emergency, intensive care and maternity, could be provided at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire, the Royal Wolverhampton Hospital Trust and Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust instead.Unison officials said earlier this week the administrators had told the union that they "were not bound by the recommendations".The town of Stafford has a population of about 63,000 people, while its surrounding borough is made up of 122,000 people.The area covered by the health trust extends beyond that, also taking in homes covered by the Cannock Chase Council area.Staffordshire Police said there was no trouble during the march.
With all the walking, running, cycling and gym activity you intend to do, obviously you need an activity tracker -a small, trusty device that you can wear 24/7 to monitor every footstep, every mile clocked up, every calorie burned, and even the quality of every moment's shuteye.You'll believe what it says. I mean, why wouldn't you?Millions of these things have been sold, and you're not exactly going to buy multiple devices to check they come up with the same results.And that's why I felt compelled to carry out this experiment for you.I've spent a full week wearing four of the latest and best-known trackers to see if they all came up with the same results.My findings? They don't. This isn't about which device presents your text messages to you, or comes in three shades of pink, but about cold, hard data.The Garmin Vivosmart, Fitbit Charge, Misfit Shine and Jawbone Up Move are all in the dock.At their worst, one day saw a variation between them of 23% in distance covered, and over the course of a week a difference in opinion between the Fitbit Charge and Jawbone Up Move of 2,649 calories burned - that's more than an entire day's calorie intake for someone of my build.Both companies are united in saying that it's not the figures that matter, but the pattern.Managing director of Fitbit Europe Gareth Jones advises people to simply be aware of the trend."Rather than get down to the half step or the next calorie is to look at the trend in their step pattern," he says,"Are they increasing the number of steps in their day all week? Are they increasing the calorie burn day to day, week to week? Because it's that trend that's going to make you healthier."It's a sentiment echoed by Jawbone's head of international partner and product development, Jorgen Nordin."What's important really is that our system is all about getting better, becoming a better version of yourself," he says.And maybe there is something in that.Goodwill, good intention, motivation to improve your lifestyle and upping your own activity may become so enshrined in this new active tracked you that you transform your entire being.Yet rely too much on the tech, inviting in third-party apps, inputting what you've eaten, and taking the figures as gospel, and you may just find it all going the wrong way.But, surely buying a device is buying into the idea that precise data matters to you?Well, Misfit's medical director Matthew Diamond explains it's not an exact science."Variations in algorithms, the sensors used, the characteristics of the individual wearing the device, like height and gait, as well as wearing position, can result in observed differences," he says.That's not dissimilar to Mr Jones's view - he puts inaccuracies down in part to the lack of a standardised algorithm.Yet it is acknowledged that trackers that incorporate heart-rate monitoring sensors offer better calorie burn accuracy, which could be interpreted as a nod to the fact they need to."Garmin's activity trackers are all about motivation, nudging the user to make healthier choices," says Chrissy Winchcombe, Garmin's marketing executive of wellness."You can also use it with a heart-rate monitor for more accurate calorie counting when exercising."Right now it feels as though a new device is launched weekly, some with looks to replicate mere watches. Others, like the Swarovski crystal, solar-powered Misfit - tracking abilities aside - would put J-Lo's bling to shame.But providing stats and prompting "do more exercise" notifications are just the start of their makers' ambitions."With wearables and looking at the Jawbone band, you know so much about the individual that you can actually start using that information to make the internet of things more like the internet of you," says Jawbone's Jorgen Nordin."For example, you've been out running, you come home. Your house knows you've been running, not just because of the temperature of your skin, but it also knows you've been sweating based on sensors."Based on that information your stereo system could be playing some cool jazz to cool you down. Your Nest thermostat can cool down the house to help you get cooler."If you're in a house with a boiler connected to your shower, that could be turned on as you walk into your house."Mr Nordin has connected his Jawbone UP to turn his coffee machine on as soon as he wakes.For most of us though, the simple question now is more likely to be: "Is it still worth me wearing an activity tracker then?"Sensors are still improving, and as we've seen, we can't expect military precision, but this is a personal choice.Will I be laying mine to rest? No chance.It makes me think more about my activity. It makes me walk instead of getting the bus.It makes me feel smug at the end of the day (usually).My husband I can compete over footsteps - don't worry, we have the same device.And now, maybe I'll work that extra bit harder just in case it's going easy on me.
Guido Tognoni worked "extremely closely" with the Fifa president during Blatter's second term."In Fifa, for many years, you could only reach your goal by taking dollars in your hands," Tognoni told BBC Sport.Fifa said investigations into such claims were ongoing and, as yet, there was no evidence of wrongdoing.The bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments is the subject of a Swiss criminal investigation.Asked if countries had any choice other than to bribe Fifa during the bidding process, Tognoni replied: "This speculation is permitted, yes."Russia and Qatar deny wrongdoing, while Blatter has not been named in a separate US criminal investigation into widespread corruption at Fifa.Domenico Scala, head of Fifa's audit and compliance committee, said if evidence emerges from either the US or Swiss investigations which shows the result was affected by bought votes, the "awards could be cancelled".However, Tognoni, who was Blatter's right-hand man for a period in the mid-90s and again between 2001-2003, said he did not think the World Cups would be taken away from Russia or Qatar."Even if there is evidence that Fifa people were bribed, where is the problem? With Fifa, or the people who had no choice but to get the World Cup with bribing?"In response, Fifa said in a statement on Monday: "Fifa initiated the investigation by the Swiss authorities precisely to answer questions such as this."However, while investigations are ongoing, it should be noted that to date, no evidence has come to light to suggest there are any legal grounds for rescinding the current Fifa World Cup selections."Seven senior Fifa officials were arrested last month in high-profile dawn raids at a Zurich hotel, where they had been staying before the presidential election.They are among 14 people charged by US prosecutors, who allege that bribes and kickbacks of more than $150m (£100m) were accepted over a 24-year period.Blatter, Fifa president since 1998, was re-elected at the Zurich meeting but announced four days later that he would resign amid the corruption allegations engulfing the organisation.American lawyer Michael Garcia was previously hired by Fifa to investigate the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding processes, but he complained that the published summary of his 430-page report was an "erroneous" representation of his work.The report cleared World Cup hosts Russia and Qatar of wrongdoing.Garcia quit weeks later over Fifa's handling of his inquiry and his comments reopened the debate about the validity of the bidding process.Scala has since had Garcia's report reviewed by legal experts, from both in and outside of sport, but neither were able to find grounds to alter the award of either tournament at this stage.
Noel Conway, who is 67 and has motor neurone disease, wants a doctor to be allowed to prescribe a lethal dose when his health deteriorates further.He said he wanted to say goodbye to loved ones "at the right time, not to be in a zombie-like condition suffering both physically and psychologically".Any doctor who helped him to die would face up to 14 years in prison.Mr Conway was too weak to attend the court in person.His lawyer, Richard Gordon QC, told the High Court in London that Mr Conway faced a stark choice either to seek to bring about his own death now whilst still physically able to do so, or await death with no control over how and when it comes.Mr Gordon said the change to the law that Mr Conway wanted would apply only to adults who are terminally ill with less than six months to live and who have a settled wish to die.Mr Conway, of Shrewsbury, told the BBC: "I will be quadriplegic. I could be virtually catatonic and conceivably be in a locked-in syndrome - that to me would be a living hell. That prospect is one I cannot accept."MPs reject 'right to die' lawBritish man dies at Dignitas centreAssisted dying debate: The key questionsMr Conway, a retired college lecturer, was once fit and active but motor neurone disease is gradually destroying all strength in his muscles.He cannot walk and increasingly relies on a ventilator to help him breathe.  As his disease progresses, he fears becoming entombed in his body.Mr Conway is being supported by the campaign group Dignity in Dying, but the issue polarises opinion.Baroness Jane Campbell - a disability rights campaigner - says changing the law would send all the wrong signals.The last major challenge to the law was turned down by the Supreme Court three years ago.It ruled that while judges could interpret the law it was up to Parliament to decide whether to change it.In 2015 MPs rejected proposals to allow assisted dying in England and Wales, in their first vote on the issue in almost 20 years.Supporters of the current legislation say it exists to protect the weak and vulnerable from being exploited or coerced.The case is expected to take up to four days.Assisted suicide - helping or encouraging another person to kill themselves - is illegal under English law.Under the terms of the Suicide Act (1961) for England and Wales, it is punishable by up to 14 year's imprisonment. In Scotland, helping someone take their own life could lead to prosecution.There have been several unsuccessful attempts to change the law, as well as some high-profile cases that have challenged it.2001: Diane Pretty, who had motor neurone disease, fought a long, and unsuccessfully, legal battle to win the right for her to end her life. She took her case to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that her husband should be given immunity from prosecution should he help her to die. She lost and died at a hospice near her home in 2002.2009: Debbie Purdy, who had multiple sclerosis, won a landmark ruling in 2009 when the courts agreed that it was a breach of her human rights not to know whether her husband would be prosecuted if he accompanied her to a Swiss clinic where she could end her life. That prompted Keir Starmer - the then Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales - to publish guidelines setting out what was taken into consideration when weighing up a prosecution. Debbie died in a hospice in England in 2014.2012: Two men suffering from locked-in syndrome lost their legal fight to be helped to die. Tony Nicklinson and a man known only as Martin - both left paralysed after a stroke - had argued that doctors should be allowed to end their lives without punishment. Martin argued that the DPP policy on encouraging or assisted suicide was not clear enough for people such as carers to know how they could provide assistance without the risk of being prosecuted. Tony Nicklinson died in August 2012 after refusing food.2016: The family of deceased locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson and paralysed road accident victim Paul Lamb lose their right-to-die challenges at the European Court of Human rights. They campaigned that disabled people should have the right to be helped to die with dignity.
Alexys Brown, also known as Lexi, died at her home in Emmadale Close, Weymouth, on Thursday.An investigation is under way to discover how she became trapped. A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out this week.It was originally hoped the appeal would raise £2,000.Alison Record, who started the Just Giving appeal, said she was "heart broken" over the death."Everybody by now has heard of the terrible tragedy the Brown family have suffered with the loss of their beautiful and beloved little girl Lexi," the appeal page reads."It is such an unimaginable pain to come to terms with; they should be free to take all the time they need to find their way through such dark times with out [sic] having to think about the devastating financial circumstance this will leave them and their children in.""This has destroyed them; they need time to be with each other so all money raised will go towards giving them time to do this."Many other comments have been posted on the appeal page.Steph Harris said: "Thinking of you all at this devastating time, fly high beautiful princess. Love Steph and family xxx"Lesley Andrews added: "No amount of money will take away the pain, but so much love comes with every penny. Take care. xx"Aster Group, the housing association responsible for managing the home, is assisting with the police investigation. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is also investigating.Dorset County Council said it had not installed the disabled lift at the property.
Laurence Shahlaei, originally from Cheltenham, took the title in Leeds from two-time title holder Hafthor Bjornsson who is also famed for his role in the popular television series.Mr Shahlaei, nicknamed "Big Loz", said: "He's a great strongman but it was my day and it felt really good to win."The 32-year-old is the first Englishman to win the title in 27 years.Standing at 6ft 2in (1.9m) and weighing 22 stone (145 kg), the Wiltshire-based athlete had to overcome injury last weekend to take the crown."I've had a rough few years with injuries and to come back and win Europe's Strongest man has just meant the world to me," he said."There's five different events that you have to do. I did a 420 kilo dead lift, which was good enough for joint second and then we did a frame carry - it's a race and you're running a 20-metre course while carrying 450 kilos, which is close to 90 stone, and I won that event."Competitors also had to lift a 177kg (28 stone) block above their heads "as many times as possible" as well as tackling the infamous Atlas stones - an event synonymous with strongman competitions.But it was running 20m (65ft) with a Volkswagen Beetle on his shoulders in around 11 seconds that clinched the title from Iceland's Hafthor Bjornsson."My favourite of the competition was the car walk.  Imagine Fred Flintstone running in his car - that was basically me," he said."I actually broke the world record on that event.  They made the car even heavier this year and I managed over a second off my world record - which was really, really good."
In an email thanking his campaign team after voting closed, Mr Burnham said getting this far was "a real achievement".BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said this was seen by some of his supporters as a concession of defeat.But a campaign source said this was "categorically not" the case.The winner of the leadership election will be announced on Saturday.Mr Burnham is up against Jeremy Corbyn, Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper in the contest.In his email, he told supporters the campaign had "tested us all on every level".He said: "But we have coped with the inevitable ups and downs with good humour and run a strong, positive and professional campaign of which you can all be very proud."Most importantly, we have stayed true to our values and competitive right to the end of the race."We end it with an outside but realistic chance of winning. That is a real achievement."Mr Burnham added that "thousands of ordinary, decent party members are now worried about where we are heading".Mr Corbyn only made it on to the ballot paper at the last minute when nominations were finalised in June but has become the bookies' favourite.On Twitter, he said it had been "an inspiring summer" regardless of the outcome of the election.This is it. The last minute phone banks, panics over missing ballots, final pleas from the candidates are done.The vote is over and now Labour's wait begins. Before the result though it seems that already the party has been changed, possibly forever by these extraordinary last few months.An unexpected candidate has done the unexpected and Jeremy Corbyn has put himself into the most likely position to win the contest. Strikingly, that is against the better judgement of nearly every single senior figure in the Labour Party, and crucially nearly all of its MPs.Read Laura's blog in fullOne of Mr Corbyn's supporters, Leeds East MP Richard Burgon, said many people would be "pleasantly surprised" at his leadership style if he won."It will be a more collegiate and a more collectivist leadership which will include people," he said. "It will include MPs who don't agree with some of Jeremy's politics."Speaking to the BBC at Mr Corbyn's final rally in his Islington North constituency, Unite General Secretary Len McCluskey said the left-wing MP had already won in his eyes.He said Mr Corbyn had "lit up our movement in a way that I didn't think was possible" after the general election, adding: "That's a victory in itself.""Jeremy, in that calm fashion seems to have touched a pulse, and that pulse is about people rejecting the constant downbeat austerity message that's been coming out of politics for thirty five years," Mr McCluskey added.Angela Eagle, who is running for the deputy Labour leadership, told the BBC she would serve whichever leader is elected, adding that the party needed to capitalise on the "enthusiasm for politics" and "hope" the contest had generated.The contest has been plagued by internal rows over Labour's direction and concerns that non-party supporters have tried to influence the outcome.Labour has said efforts to weed out non-party supporters would continue up until results day.In the closing speech of her campaign, Ms Kendall - who has stressed the need for Labour to appeal to a broader section of the electorate - said she may have been "too blunt" at times.She added: "But my view is that in politics, as in life, you cannot deal with problems by ignoring or avoiding them."There have also been claims from some people that they did not receive their ballot papers in time to vote.London mayor hopeful David Lammy said 20% of supporters who his team spoke to had received nothing.Labour said ballots had been emailed and posted out correctly to everyone entitled to vote.The party said everyone who had not voted or said they did not have a ballot had received a final email reminder on Tuesday.Labour's new deputy leader will also be unveiled at the leadership conference on Saturday, and its London mayoral candidate will be announced on Friday.

Turner, 32, recently retired after a 15-year career, winning 763 races.In 2008 she became the first female British jockey to ride 100 UK Flat winners in a year."It's nice for the girls putting in the effort and hard work that they can see there's light at the end of the tunnel," she told BBC Radio 5 live."It shows what they are working hard for is achievable."She added: "It is more difficult for women, they need to train harder because men are physically stronger."Turner rode two Group One winners at the highest level in Britain during her career, but suffered a number of injuries.She credited the support of trainer Michael Bell for giving her the opportunity to race when she was an apprentice."I find with my job it has to be all or nothing," she added. "You cannot pick and choose and have the odd day off."I have had so many thrills and had fun and loved every minute and feel the time is now right to try something different."

The Euro 2016 semi-finalists initially faced spirited Moldovan resistance but led 2-0 at half-time thanks to goals from Sam Vokes and Joe Allen.Gareth Bale seized on a woeful pass for the third, then netted a last-minute penalty for his second of the night.Wales' win puts them top of Group D on goal difference ahead of Austria.Chris Coleman's men travel to Vienna for their next World Cup qualifier on Thursday, 6 October.As the group's top seeds, Coleman's side had been expected to make light work of Moldova, who are ranked 154 places below them in the world rankings.After a cagey first half hour they eventually did so with a flourish, becoming the first team to score three or more goals against the eastern European minnows since England's 4-0 victory in 2013.Having led Wales to a first major tournament semi-final at Euro 2016, Coleman said he was "desperate" to follow that achievement by qualifying for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.The former Fulham manager and his players want to ensure their summer exploits in France were not a one-off but a springboard to sustained success.They were backed by a typically vociferous Cardiff City Stadium crowd of 31,731, close to capacity once again as a nation basks in its greatest footballing era.And although it came against limited opposition, this opening victory was an encouraging start as Wales aim to end an absence from World Cups that stretches back to 1958."That was the perfect start," former Wales international John Hartson said on Radio 5 live. "Moldova were awful, it was a comfortable win as you will see and great start to the qualifying campaign."There was a familiarity to Wales' initial inability to break Moldova down; struggling to unlock a deep and tenacious defence as they had done against Andorra and Israel during their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.Moldova had lost 14 of their past 20 games but they are seldom pushovers and have conceded only 26 goals in the process.However, Wales' domination of possession and territory eventually paid dividends after 38 minutes when Bale's arcing cross was headed in by Vokes.Five minutes later, a weak attempted clearance from Moldova goalkeeper Ilie Cebanu found its way to Allen, who scored his first goal for Wales with a drilled half-volley from the edge of the penalty area.Bale claimed Wales' third goal in comical circumstances, as he latched on to a terrible backpass from Moldova's Ion Jardan before clipping the ball neatly beyond Cebanu.The Real Madrid forward scored his second in added time, converting a penalty after he had been brought down to move within four goals of Ian Rush's Welsh record of 28.Wales' next fixture could be the toughest of their qualifying campaign, away against Group D second seeds Austria on 6 October.Austria won 2-1 in Georgia on Monday and, with Serbia and the Republic of Ireland drawing 2-2 in Belgrade, this group is expected to be wide open.Sterner challenges await Coleman's side but this victory - their biggest winning margin in a competitive game since 2003 - will lift hopes of qualifying for a first World Cup in 60 years.Match ends, Wales 4, Moldova 0.Second Half ends, Wales 4, Moldova 0.Goal!

Mark Thompson wrote in a blog that the BBC had seen "disturbing new tactics", including the targeting of family members of those working outside Iran.Last week, the sister of a BBC Persian staff member was detained and held in solitary confinement at a Tehran jail.Iran accused the BBC of inciting unrest after the disputed re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009.BBC Persian broadcast online videos and interviewed protesters, who described deaths, injuries and arbitrary arrests carried out by security forces.In his blog, Mr Thompson wrote that for BBC Persian staff, "interference and harassment from the Iranian authorities has become a challenging fact of life"."In recent months, we have witnessed increased levels of intimidation alongside disturbing new tactics," he added."This includes an attempt to put pressure on those who work for BBC Persian outside Iran, by targeting family members who still live inside the country."Mr Thompson revealed that last week the sister of a BBC Persian member of staff was arrested and held in solitary confinement on unspecified charges at Evin Prison in the capital, Tehran."Although she has now been released on bail, her treatment was utterly deplorable and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms."Human Rights Watch said that at one point, a man claiming to be the relative's interrogator at Evin telephoned the staff member in London and offered to release her in return for information about the BBC.Mr Thompson said staff had also faced false accusations of sexual assault, drug trafficking and financial crimes.In recent months, a number of relatives of BBC Persian staff had been detained for short periods of time by the Iranian authorities and urged to get their relatives in London to either stop working for the BBC, or to "co-operate" with Iranian intelligence officials, Mr Thompson said.In other instances, passports of family members have been confiscated, preventing them from leaving Iran, he added."This has left many BBC Persian staff too afraid to return to the country, even to visit sick or elderly relatives."He said some had also had their Facebook and email accounts hacked, and been subjected to a "consistent stream of false and slanderous accusations... in the official Iranian media, ranging from allegations of serious sexual assault, drug trafficking, and criminal financial behaviour".Some reports claimed they had converted from Islam to Christianity or Bahai faith - potentially a capital offence in Iran as it is considered to be apostasy.Human Rights Watch's Middle East director, Sarah Leah Whitson, said the actions of the Iranian authorities suggested they were attempting to silence reporters and the BBC, and were sending "a message that the government's long arm of repression can extend well beyond borders".UK Middle East Minister Alistair Burt said Iranian officials' "deplorable tactics illustrate again the deteriorating human rights situation in Iran, and the desperation of the Iranian regime to silence any independent voices".
The Court heard that a further pregnancy would be a "significantly life-threatening event" for both the mother and child.Mr Justice Cobb said the woman had the "same human rights" as everyone else and this was not a case of "eugenics".He has authorised health and council services to intervene and perform the sterilisation.The name of the woman has not been released, to protect the identify of her children.The Court of Protection, which rules in cases when people are unable to make decisions for themselves, heard the woman has no contact with any of her six children. All are being raised by carers.The 36-year-old's history was described as "extraordinary, tragic, and complex".Two of the children were born at home in conditions described as "unhygienic and overrun by pets".There is evidence that barbecue tongs were used as forceps, although this was denied.In another birth, the woman - known only as DD - contested there was no father and the pregnancy resulted from a "tablet from a health food shop".Mr Cobb's judgement said: "The ethical, legal and medical issues arising here are self-evidently of the utmost gravity, engaging, and profoundly impacting upon DD's personal autonomy, privacy, bodily integrity, and reproductive rights."It said there were considerable concerns about the woman's safety.Doctors said the wall of her uterus was "tissue-paper thin" and likely to rupture in childbirth, leading to almost certain death of the infant.Mr Cobb insisted: "Those who lack capacity have the same human rights as everyone else."This case is not about eugenics, this outcome has been driven by the bleak yet undisputed evidence that a further pregnancy would be a significantly life-threatening event."He has authorised a sterilisation operation, but there will be no notice given to the woman or her long-term partner, who also has learning disabilities.Rebecca Schiller, the co-chairwoman of the human rights in childbirth charity Birthrights, said: "Taking away a person's ability to have a child is truly draconian."It may be justified in extreme circumstances, but immense care must be taken to safeguard the rights of people with mental health conditions."
Fosun is offering 451m euros (Â£355m; $580m) for the business, which is 51% owned by the Espirito Santo family.The bid is higher than two rival offers from Portuguese healthcare firm Jose de Mello Saude and Mexico's Grupo Angeles.It also marks the latest European target for Fosun, which has also been trying to buy resort chain Club Med.The Chinese firm is run by billionaire Guo Guangchang, who has been likened to US investment legend Warren Buffett.Fosun has spent billions since 2010 buying up foreign firms and says it is eyeing healthcare, tourism and fashion firms in the US and Europe.It already owns a stable of Western brands ranging from the American clothing label St John's to Greek luxury jeweller Folli Follie.In January, Fosun bought Portuguese insurer Caixa Seguros e Saude.The Espirito Santo family has been looking to sell various parts of its business since applying for creditor protection in July.ESS owns hospitals, clinics and elderly care homes across Portugal and the firm has become a target for investors betting on the growing need for facilities to cope with an aging population in Europe.Shares of ESS have risen by more than 50% this year because of the takeover battle.
A series of groups spoke out after Europe's top court ruled a Romanian man whose employer read his messages had not had his rights violated.He broke company policy by using a work account to talk to his family.In response, bodies representing directors and workers, as well as privacy and human resources groups, all issued similar warnings to bosses.The European Trades Union Congress, which represents workers across the continent, said the judges' decision should not act as a "green lightâ€¦ to start snooping" on staff.The case in the European Court of Human Rights did not introduce any new rules, but acted as a stress test for those that already allowed similar surveillance by employers in some circumstances.Institute of Directors director general Simon Walker said: "Employees should not be subject to Stasi-style surveillance at work."We would strongly urge businesses not to read an employee's personal messages, apart from in the most exceptional circumstances."British Trades Union Congress general secretary Frances O'Grady said: "Big Brother bosses do not get the best out of employees."Staff who are being snooped on are less productive and less healthy".And the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said: "Employees that feel under excessive surveillance are also more likely to suffer from stress, so there needs to be a clear case for monitoring."They were joined by the privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, which said: "None of us should ever assume that what we do online during work hours or when using devices owned by our employer, such as computers, tablets or mobile phones, is private - but, equally, no employee should be in fear of being monitored by their boss."The judges' ruling, handed down on Tuesday, said Romania had not failed to uphold the right to a private life of its citizen Bogdan Barbulescu.Mr Barbulescu's employer had sacked him after finding he had been using a Yahoo Messenger account to speak to both his fiancee and his brother, despite having been asked to set up the account for work purposes only, the seven judges said.The company had also banned private use of the internet at work.When confronted, Mr Barbulescu had denied violating the policy, the judges found.And the company had therefore been justified in reading both the work and private correspondence on the account - some of it highly sensitive.Mr Barbulescu said his rights had been violated and, having been unsuccessful in arguing as much in the domestic courts, asked the judges to rule that Romania had failed in its duty to him.The court's decision does not introduce new measures.Reading the messages was already legal in Romania, as it is in other countries, including the UK.Rather, it agreed with the Romanian authorities that the circumstances in which Mr Barbulescu's messages had been read did not represent a breach of his right to a private life.The judges, in effect, declined to send a signal to courts across Europe that they considered surveillance under those circumstances unacceptable.If the judges had found the other way, the Romanian government would have been obliged to abide by their decision.Others, however, would not, because European Court of Human Rights decisions affect only the country named in the case.The effect on domestic courts is different.Each country adopts its own approach to the court's decisions.In the UK, for example, judges are obliged to take them into account, not to follow them without question, as has sometimes been claimed.Moreover, the court's decision did not actually go further than existing UK laws, which already allowed some reading of employees' communications under certain circumstances.One of the seven judges, who disagreed with his colleagues, did say that the blanket ban on private internet use at work imposed by Mr Barbulescu's former employer was unacceptable and there should be stricter regulation of when and how bosses should be allowed to carry out such surveillance.The case before the court considered the specific circumstances in which Mr Barbulescu found himself - rather than workplace surveillance as a whole - and agreed that they were not a breach of his rights.So, avoiding those would be a good start.In the UK, the amount of access employers have to employees' communications is defined by a series of laws and regulations that balance when it is lawful against when it is proportionate and necessary.Essex University professor of EU and human rights law Steve Peers told the BBC: "Employees might be violating employer policies if they install software to block tracking."It is best for people to stick to company policy on use of work equipment and use their own smartphones if they need to do something personal."Definitely the wisest course for people whose company policies allow their work emails to be read - or who believe their employer would do it anyway - is to use their own phone or tablet, and use mobile data if they can, instead of employer wi-fi."Apps that use end-to-end encryption, such as Signal, WhatsApp and others, provide an extra level of security.Broadly, "the legal principles should be similar across Europe, particularly regarding personal data, as this is derived from EU legislation", said Kathryn Dooks, an employment partner at the law firm Kemp Little.But some domestic laws and regulations would differ, she told the BBC.The banking regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, requires banking companies to "take reasonable steps to record relevant telephone conversations, and keep a copy of relevant electronic communications" on company equipment.FCA-regulated businesses must also take steps to stop staff sending work messages on their own equipment.According to a 2014 Financial Times article, some banks became so concerned employees, aware they were being watched, would move to non-work channels to engage in illicit behaviour that they started comparing performance against average internal communications channel use.
The Grocer magazine reported that the firm is charging £2.64 for a 250g jar.It is the first supermarket to raise the price of Marmite since the recent dispute between Tesco and manufacturer Unilever over the effect of the falling pound on production costs.A Morrisons spokesman said: "Sometimes we have to increase prices as a result of costs rising."Unilever has raised the wholesale price of many household products, including PG Tips tea and Pot Noodles, because falls in the value of sterling have increased the cost of products made outside the UK.The pound has lost nearly a fifth of its value since the UK voted to leave the EU in a referendum in June. It is the world's worst-performing currency on the global money markets this year.This makes imported goods more expensive because they continue to cost the same in dollars or euros, but the price is higher when converted into sterling.Morrisons said it did its best to avoid putting prices up. It added: "More often than not we have been reducing prices and more than 3,000 products are currently cheaper in our supermarkets than they were last year."Tesco's row with Unilever broke out earlier this month and has since been resolved, according to both sides.However, the Grocer reported that both Tesco and Asda have raised prices on a number of Unilever products, and Morrisons has also increased the prices of other items made by the company.According to supermarket websites, a 250g pot of Marmite costs £2.64 at Morrisons, £2.50 at Sainsbury's, £2.35 at both Waitrose and Tesco and is on special at Asda for £2.
Action on Hearing Loss Cymru said its south east Wales support service is one-of-a-kind with nothing similar elsewhere in Wales.It said "demand outweighs supply" for its two advisers and the referral process is "problematic".The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said it had a number of relevant "tailored" services and funded others for those who need extra help.Action on Hearing Loss estimates 4% of the Welsh workforce - about 84,000 people - are deaf or wear hearing aids.The charity's employment service, which is funded by the DWP, has run for two years and received 29 referrals.It has now been extended until December.The charity told the Eye on Wales programme it had been "overwhelmed with demand" and, without it, there would be "no support for deaf people looking for work in Wales".Richard Williams, director of the charity in Wales, said: "Demand is far outweighing supply and our two advisors are currently only able to support clients in the south east Wales area."No support is available throughout the rest of Wales for deaf clients."The referral process is also problematic; jobseekers must be referred by their Disability Employment Advisor (DEA) on the first Monday of every month by telephone call, which creates a further barrier for those people looking for work."Of the 29 people referred so far, six have gone into long-term employment and several more are still on the programme.Construction worker Jack Griffiths, 25, of Tredegar, Blaenau Gwent, who was born profoundly deaf, found his confidence "ebbing away" when he struggled to find work."Nobody was keener to get into work than me. And when you hear 'no' all the time, constant disappointment - it becomes a hard struggle to keep on applying," he said.But he managed to get a job at Willis Construction in Cardiff after getting help from the charity."I feel better about myself. I am learning," he said. "When you're not working, you're not learning or progressing."The charity's research suggests people who are deaf or hard of hearing are four times more likely to be unemployed than a hearing person."Every month our advisors are approached by deaf people desperate for support in finding employment but did not make it through the referral system and will have to wait another month," Mr Williams said.The DWP said it was "committed to helping disabled people" to find and stay in work."As well as tailored help available through the Personal Support Package and Access to Work, our Jobcentre Plus disability employment advisors are working with thousands of people every day to provide the extra support that they need," a spokeswoman said."We recognise there will be some people who need even more specialist help. That's exactly why we fund organisations such as Action on Hearing Loss in Wales through the Specialist Employability Support programme and we're currently considering how to extend this support in the future."The Welsh Government said it was in the process of refreshing its Framework for Action on Independent Living, a programme designed to help remove barriers for people with disabilities, including on employment."We are working with the DWP to raise awareness amongst employers and disabled people of the Access to Work scheme, which provides equipment and other support, including communication support,  so deaf and disabled people can access the same employment opportunities as everyone else," a spokeswoman added.For more on this story listen to Eye on Wales, BBC Radio Wales, at 12:30 BST on Sunday 9 July
Police were targeted with fireworks, while motorists described "petrol bombs" being thrown at cars on Commercial Road, Pill, on 20 October.Three teenagers - aged 16 to 17 - were sentenced to five months' custody at Cwmbran Youth Court on Tuesday.Two 13-year-olds were handed non-custodial 12-month referral orders.All five of the teenagers - who cannot be named - had earlier admitted violent disorder, with one of the 16-year-olds also admitting a separate charge of breaching a dispersal order.District Judge David Parsons said no other sentences could be justified because of the "uninhibited, unlawful behaviour".Prosecutor Paul Hewitt told the court police received calls at 19:45 BST to say youths had set off fireworks.Officers arrived at the scene but a lit firework was thrown at them and, when about 20 youths began throwing stones and eggs, they retreated."At about 20:35, police were called to another riot on Commercial Road, where there were fires being set in bins and fireworks thrown at buildings," Mr Hewitt said."There was a large group in the street, throwing items at vehicles. The windscreen of a police van was smashed by a brick, causing significant damage."Mr Hewitt described wheelie bins being set alight and put into the road, "petrol bombs" being thrown at vehicles with "terrified" motorists making three-point turns to escape.He added: "Local people were terrified. Police feared their vehicles would be pelted with fireworks and the entire area was under siege."A dispersal order was issued and a police helicopter was used to tell the crowd on loudspeaker."Locals and motorists described "missiles and bombs" being thrown at cars and thousands of pounds worth of damage caused.A video taken on a mobile phone was shown, with a youth heard shouting "there are Molotov cocktails out here, throw it" as cars were set alight.Judge Parsons handed each of the three older defendants - two were aged 16 and one 17 - a 10-month detention and training order, half of which will be served in custody with the rest under supervision in the community.He said the court had an "overwhelming obligation" to "protect the public in their homes or businesses or in the street"."Those that partake in disturbances of this magnitude, causing harm and fear to even the most steel-hearted of residents, must be punished accordingly," he added.

The jury ruled that neither sheriff's officials nor jailers committed a crime in their treatment of Bland.It has not yet been determined whether the police officer who arrested her should face charges, a prosecutor said.The 28-year-old African-American was arrested after a confrontation with a policeman who had pulled her car over. She was found dead three days later.In recent years, the deaths of black Americans in police custody have caused much debate and protests in the US.Police say that Ms Bland hanged herself while being held in the Waller County jail.The family have denied that she was suicidal and have accused the jail of being "reckless" in disregarding her safety and failing to keep her free from harm.The Waller County grand jury would return in January to consider whether to indict police officer Brian Encinia, who arrested Ms Bland in July, prosecutor Darrell Jordan said.A video of the arrest shows Mr Encinia giving Ms Bland a warning. The situation quickly escalates, with Mr Encinia appearing to threaten Ms Bland after she refuses to get out of her car.He unsuccessfully tries to pull her out and tells her "I will light you up".Ms Bland's family has alleged Mr Encinia falsified an assault allegation to take her into custody.An attorney representing Ms Bland's family, Cannon Lambert, said on Monday that the grand jury's decision was consistent with what the family believed was an attempt by authorities to cover up the events surrounding Ms Bland's death."They continue to do things we are disappointed in," he said.Ms Bland's sister Shante Needham has said Sandra had called her from jail, saying she did not know why she had been arrested and that an officer had possibly broken her arm.Ms Bland died by asphyxiation after using a plastic bag to hang herself in her cell, according to Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathias.Video footage from the jail did not show what happened inside Ms Bland's cell, but did suggest no-one entered or left it until someone found her unconscious.Mr Mathis has said there is nothing in that investigation "that shows anything happened but she killed herself".
Kiel Hauley, 33, Jonas Marcius, 23, and Adrian Morley, 33, deny assaulting and murdering Craig Grant, of Inverurie, outside the Galleria shopping centre in August last year.Witness Shaun Wheeldon said he saw Mr Grant being held on the pavement.He said he was "shocked" to see Mr Grant's face was light grey.Mr Wheeldon told the High Court in Aberdeen he could see two men restraining Mr Grant on the ground outside Tonik and stopped to speak to a bouncer.He said:  "He just said he had been in the club and he was highly drunk."Mr Wheeldon said there was "quite a commotion" outside the bar with a lot of people standing outside.Advocate depute James Keegan QC asked: "How did you react when you saw his face?"He replied: "I was shocked at the colour of him. He was light grey."Mr Keegan asked: "When you saw the colour of him what did you think?"He replied: "That he was in a bad way."He said Mr Grant's friends were trying to intervene when police arrived at the scene because he had shown no response on the ground.He told the court police took over and tried to sit him up.He said: "They sat him up like a teddy bear. It wasn't a recovery position."Mr Keegan asked: "When you say a teddy bear what do you mean by that?"He replied: "Because he was limp."The trial continues.
Angus Carpenter, of Liverpool, who has played in the city centre for more than 30 years, denied three counts of fraud.The 62-year-old was found guilty of one count when he played with a Hillsborough Justice Campaign banner draped on his bagpipes in April 2015.He was cleared of the two other counts by a jury at Liverpool Crown Court.Sgt Chris Gaynor told the court during the two day trial that Carpenter, from Woolton, gave the impression he was collecting cash for the Hillsborough Justice Campaign.In his defence, Carpenter - who usually wears a kilt and piper's regalia when he performs - said he had piped for the charity in the past but on this occasion he was simply busking.Kenneth Derbyshire, chairman of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, said he had given Carpenter permission to design and display a banner featuring the eternal flame and the word justice.But he said he had made it clear he was not use it to collect funds for the charity.Carpenter told the court the banner was a tribute to the victims, not an attempt to deceive anyone.He also told the court he was a familiar face on match days at Anfield and known as a busker to the Hillsborough Justice Campaign.He will be sentenced in January.
The Frenchman will over see back-to-back qualifiers against Cape Verde, the top-ranked African team.A seven-day, 50-match schedule starts on Wednesday and the co-Group F leaders meet in Praia Saturday and in Marrakech Tuesday in key matches as only mini-league winners are guaranteed places at the finals in Gabon.Both countries beat Sao Tome e Principe convincingly and Libya narrowly in previous group games, with Cape Verde topping the table on goal difference.Nations Cup qualifying fixtures and resultsRenard, a 47-year-old who succeeded Badou Zaki last month after indifferent Moroccan performances, guided no-hopers Zambia to 2012 glory and repeated the feat with perennial underachievers Ivory Coast last year.Hassan Shehata coached Egypt to three consecutive titles between 2006 and 2010, but only Renard has won the Nations Cup with different countries.His successes in Africa contrast with failures in France. He could not prevent Sochaux being relegated and a second Ligue 1 stint ended this season with Lille sacking him.Given that Morocco are ranked only 19th in Africa, Renard has been set a tough target of at least reaching the 2017 Nations Cup semi-finals by his new employers.And while some pundits remain sceptical as to whether Cape Verde are the strongest African national football team, they are chasing a third consecutive finals  appearance.Like Morocco, Cape Verde will have a new coach with local Felisberto 'Beto' Cardoso succeeding Portuguese Rui Aguas, who quit after not being paid for seven months.Cape Verdean football officials said the salary was supposed to be paid by Portugal under a development and co-operation agreement between the countries.Former assistant coach Cardoso will rely heavily on Djaniny and Heldon for goals while Moroccan sharpshooter Youssef El Arabi bagged a brace in Spain at the weekend.Renard has successfully persuaded France-born Lille midfielder Sofiane Boufal to play for the country where his parents were born.Other high-profile showdowns involve Nigeria and Egypt in Group G and Cameroon and South Africa in Group M.Nigeria, who have home advantage first, are another team with a new coach as Samson Siasia took over when Sunday Oliseh quit following a social media rant against his critics.Those called up for the Super Eagles include 19-year-old Alex Iwobi, whose first English Premier League start for Arsenal was crowned by the second goal in a 2-0 weekend win at Everton.The youngster suffered a scare when he fell ill and was taken to hospital in Abuja on Tuesday but he has made a recovery and will be fit to play."Had The Maddest Food Poisoning But I Am Good Now & Feeling Ready For The Egyptian Match," Iwobi Tweeted.Argentina-born Egypt coach Hector Cuper has recalled 43-year-old Nations Cup-winning goalkeeper Essam El Hadary after an injury ruled out first choice Sherif Ekramy.The squad also includes in-form Roma striker Mohamed Salah and mid-season Arsenal recruit Mohamed Elneny.Egypt, whose three titles in a row were followed by failures to qualify for the last three tournaments, beat Tanzania and Chad convincingly to lead Nigeria by two points.South Africa coach Ephraim 'Shakes' Mashaba has come under media fire for picking out-of-favour players like Bournemouth striker Tokelo Rantie for must-win games against Cameroon.Bafana Bafana were held by Gambia and lost to Mauritania, leaving them bottom of the table and five points adrift of the Indomitable Lions.New Belgium-born Cameroon coach Hugo Broos has recalled Alex Song, whose last appearance ended prematurely with a 2014 World Cup red card against Croatia.Another African in the running to play for the first time since the last World Cup is United States-based Ghana goalkeeper Adam Kwarasey.The Group H leaders will lack injured midfielder Andre Ayew against bottom-of-the-table Mozambique, but younger brother Jordan is among the strikers chosen by coach Avram Grant.Home and away fixtures against lowly-ranked Sudan offer defending champions Ivory Coast a realistic chance to win in Abidjan and Khartoum and build a four-point Group I lead.
It is the first time an unsigned artist has won the honour - which has previously gone to Adele and Sam Smith."I can't believe this is happening," said the 23-year-old, from south London. "It's all just so ridiculous!"Four of the top five Sound of 2017 acts are black British women, reflecting a rise of female talent in grime and R&B.Ray said she wanted her music to "empower women to live life as they want"."There are so many societal pressures on women, on how we should behave, and they're all based on male privilege."The Sound of 2017 list was chosen by a panel of 170 DJs, critics and festival bookers.Among them was Jamal Edwards, whose SB:TV YouTube channel has helped launch the careers of Dizzee Rascal, Stormzy and Ed Sheeran.He said he was "blown away" when he saw Ray BLK perform at one of his club nights last year."She is the whole package," he said. "I know she's going to have an amazing year.""Some artists have that magic about them," said Radio 1's Huw Stephens. "She has a real, raw talent that cuts through so strongly. She is the real deal."Born in Nigeria and raised in London, Ray released her first recordings while studying for an English degree. She worked in an advertising agency to sustain her career in its early days.Combining her love of hip-hop and R&B, she delivers streetwise, literate lyrics with a velvety soul voice. Her standout track, My Hood, is a bittersweet love letter to her home town, Catford."The south east is one of the roughest places in London but it rears the strongest people, and that's what makes us special," she said.The singer has avoided signing a record deal in order to retain the rights to her music, which she releases on her own label.Like an increasing number of artists, from Paul McCartney to the Pet Shop Boys, she works with a company called Kobalt Music Services - who provide "back-room" support like publishing and distribution, without tying musicians to restrictive contracts."I feel as though I need to have my autonomy for now," Ray told the BBC."There've been so many artists in 2016 that came out, who did so independently and experienced a lot of success. I think there's a new wave of people doing that. The industry is changing."The winning soul singer, whose real name is Rita Ekwere, beat blues singer Rag N Bone Man to top the Sound of 2017 list, while third place went to pop star-in-waiting Raye.Ray said: "I'm particularly proud to be a part of this year's list as it's full of so much talent, some of whom are independent artists like myself which I really hope inspires the next generation."The Sound of... list launched in 2003 and has a track record in championing new and innovative acts, including 50 Cent, Haim, Frank Ocean, Ellie Goulding and Florence + The Machine.According to the rules, acts on the longlist should not be well known - so talent show contestants and members of famous bands launching a solo career are excluded.Artists must not have had a UK top 20 single or album before 30 October 2016 - although guest vocalists remain eligible.Last year's victor was Jack Garratt, whose debut album Phase entered the charts at number three. He praised the "very diverse" range of acts on 2017 longlist, which also included agitprop rock band Cabbage and folk-pop ingenue Maggie Rogers."This list shows it is possible to have a great ear for melody and not just write the same four chords in different keys."2017 is going to be such an incredible year for art, especially given how terrible 2016 was for politics."We've all got a lot to write about and I think we're going to write some incredible stuff."Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Demonstrators marched outside the Iranian embassy accusing Tehran of interfering in Afghanistan's affairs.Soaring fuel prices have angered many Afghans at a time of high demand during winter.Afghan officials say 2,500 fuel tankers are stranded at the border. Iran denies blocking fuel exports to Afghanistan.It is thought the Iranian government fears the fuel could be used by foreign forces, but Afghan officials say these concerns are unfounded.Earlier this week Iran's ambassador in Kabul, Fadahoseyn Malaki, dismissed reports that Iran had barred fuel exports to Afghanistan."We give fuel to the Afghan nation," he told a news conference, although he added his government still had concerns which "should be addressed".Friday's demonstration was led by Afghan MP Najib Kabuli, who has organised similar protests against Iran in the past.
Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary said some forces are "downgrading" 999 calls, in order to justify responding to them more slowly.HMIC's report found that most of the 43 forces in England and Wales were providing a good service.But that others have let victims down.The inspectors said there are now too few detectives and in some areas an erosion of neighbourhood policing.The former chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, Sir Peter Fahy, said that forces will have to do things differently in the future, if the government continues to ask them "to do more with less".In its annual report on forces, the inspectors said officers were arresting fewer people and too many crimes were being shelved without proper investigation.It found that 67,000 people suspected of crimes were not entered onto the police national computer - so that all forces were made aware of them.The report highlighted measures some forces had deployed to manage demand - although in each case it was not entirely clear whether they were directly caused by cuts or local management decisions.HMIC said:"We are leading to a very serious conclusion regarding the potentially perilous state of British policing," said Zoe Billingham, the lead inspector."Over the last few years, HMIC has said consistently that police forces were managing well in increasingly difficult circumstances."Nonetheless, today, I'm raising a red flag to warn forces of the consequences of what is, to all intents and purposes, an unconscious form of rationing."Rated "Outstanding": DurhamRated "Good": Avon & Somerset, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, City of London, Cleveland, Cumbria, Derbyshire, Dorset, Essex, Greater Manchester, Gwent, Kent, Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Merseyside, Norfolk, North Wales, North Yorkshire, Northumbria, South Wales, Suffolk, Surrey, Thames Valley, Warwickshire, West Mercia, West Midlands, West Yorkshire and Wiltshire.Rated "Requires Improvement": Devon & Cornwall, Dyfed-Powys, Gloucestershire, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Humberside, Leicestershire, Metropolitan Police, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire, Staffordshire and SussexRated "Inadequate": BedfordshireHMIC also warned there was now a "national crisis" caused by a shortage of detectives - with the Metropolitan Police alone short by 700.One ex-detective has told the Victoria Derbyshire programme why she quit her "dream job".These shortages had led to excessive workloads and stress for investigators who were sometimes carrying out complex investigations without the right skills and experience.In one area, inspectors found a uniformed officer carrying out a rape investigation. HMIC has urged police chiefs to come up with a plan by the summer to attract, recruit and train more detectives.Ms Billingham warned that while neighbourhood teams were the "bedrock of British policing" they were being "chipped away... sometimes by stealth".A survey of neighbourhood officers found they were being pulled from local duties at least once a week to supervise the detention or transport of suspects. A fifth of the officers said they could find themselves on other duties three times a week.One police officer resigned last week after 13 years in the Devon and Cornwall, publishing a damning resignation letter on social media criticising police for "putting their employees last".Dr Alan Billings, South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I don't think I've ever read a report from the Inspectorate that was quite as sobering as this."Dr Billings said there was "no doubt" that neighbourhood policing was under pressure, adding: "I think that's true of my own area - because if people are really pressured to answer 999 calls, deal with incidents, they're going to pull officers out of neighbourhood areas."He said HMIC's report reflects what is happening across the public sector."You can't get away from the fact that all of us are now trying to do more and better with less."And year on year, we're receiving less funding. Now of course a police force cannot run a deficit - so you have to make the books balance, and that leads sometimes to poor decisions."Chief Constable Michael Barton of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said budgets had fallen by 22% in five years - leading to a loss of 32,000 officers and staff - at a time when many crimes were changing."It's a simple reality that we are required to prioritise more," he said. "Difficult decisions are being made between resourcing neighbourhood teams, response units, specialist investigations and digital and cyber-enabled crime. There are no easy answers."Ms Billingham said the failings were "not simply about money" because there was a huge variation in results, in particular in how well forces were winning the support of domestic violence victims in how they investigated and concluded cases.Policing Minister Brandon Lewis said: "This Government has protected police funding, through the 2015 spending review."There can be no excuse for any force that fails to deliver on its obligations. Those identified as inadequate or requiring improvement must take HMIC's findings very seriously and I expect to see rapid improvementBut the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file members, described the report as a "worrying wake-up call".And Jon Boutcher, chief constable of Bedfordshire, criticised his force's rating as inadequate, saying community policing had to change because of the huge demand for specialist officers to deal with domestic abuse, sexual offences and the rising threat of online-related crimes.
Ball, who featured against Pakistan A in Dubai, has taken six wickets in each of Notts' first two games and is the leading wicket-taker in Division One of the County Championship so far in 2016.Read said of the 25-year-old: "Last winter he got fitter and stronger."Now he's genuinely lively and he does plenty with the new ball."Read said Ball's assured early showings have demanded he lead Notts' bowling attack with the new ball alongside England's Stuart Broad."Jake is in fantastic form with the ball," continued Read. "He's had a great winter having been in Dubai with the Lions and has had a taste of what life is like with the ECB set-up. He's really keen to progress that side of his career."Notts director of cricket Mick Newell said Ball, who was their second-highest County Championship wicket taker with 39 last season, said he has been "terrific" so far in 2016."That's a fantastic start to the season and he's setting a great example," added Newell.Despite Ball's efforts against Lancashire, Notts suffered an eight-wicket defeat in their second Country Championship match of the season on Wednesday, having beaten Surrey in their opening fixture.
John Coyle tried to rob a Scotmid store in Glasgow's Easterhouse, but left empty-handed after the worker shouted to her mother who also worked there.The High Court in Glasgow heard that Coyle's "very distinctive" hair could be seen on the footage.The 43-year-old, from Cranhill, will be sentenced in the new year.It emerged Coyle had served a number of lengthy jail terms for similar crimes.He had only recently been released after being jailed for a robbery in 2009 before the latest attack in October.
Tom Stilwell fell from his neighbour's balcony in his apartment block in Auckland at 02:00 local time on Sunday (14:00 GMT on Saturday), reports said.He was trying to lower himself onto his balcony, which was directly below his neighbour's, when he fell, police said.His friends said that he had bone fractures and internal injuries, but was "fine" and "a very lucky man".He was awake and laughing on Monday, but had no recollection of what happened, his friends told New Zealand newsgroup Fairfax Media."He looks alright," his flatmate, Beth Goodwin, said. "It's more internal injuries. He's broken some bones in his ribs and neck but they're not important bones.""The odds may be against it, but others have lived after even more dramatic plummets."Juliane Koepcke, 17, was flying over the Peruvian rainforest with her mother when her plane was hit by lightning. But she survived a two-mile (3.2km) fall."In January 1972, 22-year-old Yugoslav flight attendant Vesna Vulovic's plane exploded following a suspected terrorist bomb. The Guinness Book of Records recorded that Ms Vulovic plummeted 33,000ft (10,160m) before landing in snow."Read moreIn a statement, New Zealand police said: "It appears that the man was locked out of his 14th floor apartment. He fell while attempting to climb down the outside of the building from a 15th floor apartment directly above his, in an effort to gain access via his balcony."There were "no suspicious circumstances surrounding the fall", the statement added.The 20-year-old is said to be in New Zealand on a working holiday.Mr Stilwell discovered he was locked out of his flat early on Sunday, and asked a neighbour if he could climb down from her balcony into his flat, his friends said.The neighbour, Geraldine Bautista, told the New Zealand Herald that Mr Stilwell was "a little tipsy" but polite."I wasn't scared of him - he just requested 'Can you please let me jump off from the balcony? I will not bother you, just let me use your balcony.'""I never thought he would really do that. In my mind I thought 'Okay, I'll just let you see that it's really impossible. I didn't think he'd jump, because it's really scary."However, he quickly pulled himself over the balcony railing before she could stop him, she said."I thought I was dreaming... it happened within seconds," she said. "I couldn't even scream for help."Mr Stilwell's fall was broken by the roof of an adjacent building, reportedly some 13 floors below.He was taken to hospital in a critical condition, but was in a satisfactory condition by Monday, a hospital spokesperson said.Dr Tony Smith, a medical director at St John, an emergency healthcare organisation, told the New Zealand Herald that a person's chances of survival were increased if they were able to break their fall on something.However, "survival from falls of that height are extraordinarily unusual", he said.In December 2007, New York window cleaner Alcides Moreno plummeted 47 floors when cables holding the platform he and his brother were working on failed. His brother died but Mr Moreno made a full recovery, something doctors attributed in part to his escaping major head injuries.In June 2010 a four-year-old boy escaped with minor injuries after falling from the 17th floor of a hotel in Miami. Joey Williams, who bounced off palm trees as he fell to the 10th-floor pool area, was sitting up in bed by the next day.
The base will be home to HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, the largest ships ever built for the navy.Work on Portsmouth's jetty, built in the 1920s and last upgraded in the 1970s, has begun, with upgrades expected to be completed next autumn.It forms part of a Â£100m infrastructure package to prepare the base for the arrival of the first carrier.HMS Queen Elizabeth measures 280m (300 yards) long and can travel up to 500 miles (800km) a day.The ship's systems are being tested and it will conduct sea trials next year before being handed over to the Royal Navy.It is expected to come into service in 2020.HMS Prince of Wales is being constructed at shipyards around the UK before it is assembled at Rosyth.Once completed, the revamped naval base is expected to create hundreds of jobs in Portsmouth.In November 2013, BAE Systems announced it was ending shipbuilding in Portsmouth, leading to 585 voluntary redundancies, 160 compulsory redundancies, and the redeployment of 175 members of staff.
Japan should learn "profound lessons from history", China's defence ministry said after Japan's parliamentary vote.The vote allows Japanese troops to fight overseas for the first time since the end of World War Two 70 years ago.Tensions between China and Japan have escalated in recent months over a group of islands to which both lay claim.The security laws were voted through Japan's upper house late on Friday, with 148 lawmakers voting in support and 90 against.It followed nearly 200 hours of political wrangling, with scuffles breaking out at various points between the bills' supporters and opposition members attempting to delay the vote.Compiled by BBC MonitoringThe government says that the changes in defence policy are vital to meet new military challenges such as those posed from a rising China.But China's defence ministry said on Saturday they "run counter to the trend of the times that upholds peace, development and co-operation", the Xinhua news agency reports."The move has breached the restrictions of Japan's pacifist constitution," the ministry added.Many Japanese who opposed the bills - which prompted large public protests - were also attached to the pacifist provisions in the constitution that banned fighting overseas.China also urged Japan to "heed the security concern" of its Asian neighbours and do more to promote regional peace and stability.South Korea, which also has a tense relationship with Japan, has warned Tokyo not to exercise the new defence laws without its approval.But the US, Japan's ally, and the UK have both welcomed the changes.UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said he looked forward to Japan "taking an increasingly active part in peacekeeping operations".Japan's post-World War Two constitution bars it from using force to resolve international conflicts except in cases of self-defence.The new security legislation allows Japan's military to mobilise overseas when these three conditions are met:What's behind Japan's military shift?Critics say the changes violate the pacifist constitution and could lead Japan into US-led wars abroad.Supporters of the measures insist they are essential for the defence of Japan and its regional allies, and will permit greater involvement in peacekeeping activities around the world.Critics have focused on what they say is ambiguity in how the principles of the legislation will be interpreted, and the possibility that future governments will interpret them more broadly.
Home manager Brendan Rodgers had changed to three at the back to allow Leigh Griffiths to play alongside Moussa Dembele up front.But Inverness kept them at bay until Scott Sinclair pounced to fire home after the break.Griffiths tapped in before Caley Thistle's Greg Tansey was sent off and Tom Rogic blasted home the third.That second yellow card, which came moments after the second goal, well and truly ended Caley Thistle's hopes of frustrating Celtic for a second time this season.And Celtic, whose only dropped points this season came at Caledonian Stadium, cruised to a sixth straight domestic clean sheet to stretch their lead over Aberdeen, who have also played one game more than the reigning champions.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers decided to change his much-recognised shape following the midweek Champions League draw in Germany.He opted for a back three and a front two of Dembele and Griffiths, but it was an experiment that only lasted for 13 minutes due to injury.Mikael Lustig hobbled off with a nasty looking ankle knock after a tussle with Josh Meekings.Dembele and Griffiths continued to link up, but Stuart Armstrong was ordered to fill in at right back.The tinkering looked to upset the Celtic rhythm and, at times in the first half, they looked to be operating within themselves.Caley Thistle manager Richie Foran said before the game that his side would press and frustrate the reigning champions and, for long spells of the first period, they did just that.They closed Celtic down well and prevented them from finding the gear that would ultimately give them the lead.But even the most pessimistic of the home supporters knew it was only a matter of time.The chances were being created and the Inverness door was creaking.The defences were breached early in the second half and the opening goal came courtesy of a now familiar and formidable name.Sinclair latched on to a defence-splitting pass from Callum McGregor and blasted low past goalkeeper Owen fon Wiliams for his 10th goal of the season.Griffiths was keen to impress in a rare start and he found the net after Dembele's effort was parried by Fon Williams.Greg Tansey was given a second yellow card for a foul on McGregor in the build up and that killed off any slim hopes of a Caley Thistle come back.Rogic came off the bench to add a third, but with Lustig and captain Scott Brown hobbling off, the win may well have come at a price.Match ends, Celtic 3, Inverness CT 0.Second Half ends, Celtic 3, Inverness CT 0.Attempt saved.

When I first met him, I was impressed with his focus on the job and the preparations he wanted to do."Sometimes you introduce people in order to improve you and that is what the powers that be see Wayne doing."Whether we need an Aussie or Kiwi to do that, as long as it is pushing our sport forward, that is the main decision that comes into it."During McNamara's five-and-a-half-year reign, England were runners-up in the 2011 Four Nations and also reached the semi-finals of the 2013 World Cup.The former Bradford coach's last game in charge saw his side complete a 2-1 series win over New Zealand, the world's number one side.Despite improvement on the international stage, Australian National Rugby League sides thrashed their Super League counterparts in all three games during the World Club Series earlier this year."Looking at the World Club Series games, you will see we haven't bridged the gap. But, with the number of top English players we have produced at international level, we are bridging the gap there," added O'Loughlin."We won the series against New Zealand last year, which was a massive step forward for us. We have teams who are more than capable of competing in the NRL. If Wigan went there, we would improve because of the strength of the competition."We may not win more games but it would improve our players massively. Coaches and players over here are always looking to get better and we keep trying to bridge the gap."Full-back Sam Tomkins returned to England with Wigan Warriors after a two-year spell with New Zealand Warriors, but has been unable to play this season because of a long-term knee injury.Forward Sam Burgess also returned to rugby league with the South Sydney Rabbitohs after a one-season spell with English rugby union side Bath."Just having a bloke like Tomkins back at the club is great," said O'Loughlin. "He has been good for the youngsters who have been playing in his position. He is always there to give his opinion at the club, he is a is positive influence."Burgess is a phenomenal player and it is great to have him back in an England jersey. He is is an inspirational player and does his job very well. He is very influential on the team and gets the best from the players around him."He is a good leader too. With him in the side, you have a better chance of winning."

Yet again, you feel for the families of those killed on board, and the people that actually survived the ordeal.It seems never ending. In less than a year two Malaysian aircraft have been lost, with 537 people on board.The AirAsia accident - en route to Singapore in December - killed 162. It is not just the accidents. It's the fact that whole aircraft are going down without warning.You would be forgiven for thinking that flying is becoming more lethal.But you would be wrong.In fact, when you look at the number of crashes and fatalities compared to the huge number of people flying today (3.2 billion passengers last year), we are in a golden era of aircraft safety.According to safety analysts Ascend, 2014 was narrowly the safest year ever, with one fatal accident per 2.38 million flights, compared to every 1.91 million flights the year before.It must be noted that that does not include the loss of the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine, where 298 people died, which they count as a war loss rather than an accident.But even with that flight added it is not a terrible year, historically.Another respected organisation, the Aviation Safety Network, registers 21 fatal accidents in 2014 (this time including Ukraine), compared to 29 in 2013 and 23 the year before that.Nearly 1,000 people died in 2014, which is 700 more than the year before.Horrible numbers, but compare that to the worst year, 1972, when 2,370 passengers were killed - and far fewer people were flying then, maybe a quarter of the number travelling today.So why is flying getting safer? Well, technology."Think of your car in the 1970s", David Learmount, from Flightglobal tells me."The brakes, the handling, the lack of safety features. Well, aircraft are exactly the same."We knew most things about aerodynamics by the 1940s. What has changed is the technology."Every new generation of aircraft has been safer than the one before. Better computers, design, materials.But there is another sobering factor at play here too. Every tragedy has taught designers something new.Go back a couple of decades and the biggest killer was something called Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT).A benign name with a morbid outcome, it normally involved a perfectly serviceable aircraft coming into land, then hitting something on the ground without the crew even knowing it was there.Many airports are near hills.Then along came a piece of equipment that was to transform safety: the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System."It's like a sat nav that can help you thread your way through hills and mountains, even in clouds", David says.Here is another example of how disaster has led to safer flying.In 1985 a British Airtours aircraft was taking off from Manchester Airport, en route to Corfu.The pilots aborted at the last minute because one of the engines failed, but the aircraft was also on fire.Fifty-four people died fleeing the smoke, the aisles were jammed with passengers panicking to get out.Next time you fly, look at the floor.You will probably see strip lights along both sides of the aisle, then they turn and lead to each exit.That idea comes straight from the Manchester fire. The lights mean passengers can find the exit, even crawling on their hands and knees through thick smoke."Our founder was actually working on emergency guide lights to help people escape from nuclear power stations and submarines," says Nigel Duncan, boss of STG aerospace."This accident made him realise they could be used in planes too".Nigel's company now supplies guiding lights for the floors of 9,000 airliners. They are photoluminescent, "which means they are fail-safe"."It's a chemical process so they don't need power -  sever it and it still works," he says.For the most part, computers fly modern airliners.And they are very good at it. But all of this safety-driven automation has led to a new safety concern that is uncomfortable to hear.Pilots don't get enough practice at actually flying planes. The computer has taken them out of the loop.Six years ago, Air France flight 447 crashed into the Atlantic, killing 228 people.Yet there was nothing critically wrong with the plane.So why did it crash? Well, the weather was bad and a small tube froze up, knocking out the speed indicator.The actual speed was fine, but the speed data on their screens was all over the place.Suddenly, the computer didn't know how fast it was going, and it handed control back to the pilots.Confused, in bad weather, in darkness and taken by surprise, they couldn't work out what was happening, so they kept climbing to the point where the aircraft stalled, effectively stopping in mid-air and falling from the sky.Unsurprisingly, plenty in the industry want more hands-on training for pilots."A few years ago the airlines used to get more crew from the military and those guys were used to manually flying aircraft right on the edge", David Learmount tells me."Today, many pilots don't have that kind of background training."Having said all of that, just bear in mind:Nothing is ever without risk, but the chances of dying in an aircraft "accident" are lower than ever.
Mr Duncan Smith has warned the government risks dividing society with politically-motivated spending cuts.Mr Cameron is to reject this - and No 10 has rubbished claims of a rift with George Osborne, saying the chancellor still has the PM's full confidence.The disability cuts Mr Duncan Smith quit over will be shelved.Downing Street said the changes to Personal Independence Payments (PIP) announced ahead of Mr Osborne's Budget last week would not go ahead "in their current form".But alternative proposals for saving the Â£4bn earmarked for the savings would not come until the Autumn Statement towards the end of the year.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for Mr Osborne's resignation and Conservative MPs have spoken out against the leadership with Mr Duncan Smith's former ministerial team divided in their responses to his resignation.Treasury minister David Gauke is answering an urgent Commons question from Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell on changes to the Budget - Mr McDonnell had called for the chancellor himself but this appears to have been ignored.This will be followed by a statement from Mr Cameron - ostensibly on last week's EU summit - at which he is expected to restate his commitment to "compassionate Conservatism" and reject Mr Duncan Smith's criticisms of his style of government.Former Tory leader Lord Howard urged MPs to "listen to what the prime minister has to say" and to "calm down".Mr Duncan Smith set out the reasons for his surprise resignation in an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr, in which he said the way Mr Osborne had cut benefits in his Budget at the same time as cutting taxes for the better off was "deeply unfair" and that he had become "semi detached" from government.Ross Hawkins, BBC political correspondentGeorge Osborne: chief tactician and patron, a man whose word makes or wrecks careers.That was the view of many Tory MPs for a very long time. Now, many doubt he will ever be their leader, or even the chancellor much longer.It's not that they think David Cameron is poised to sack him or that he's about to resign, as Labour demand.They simply believe a swift leadership election is highly likely whatever the result of 23 June's EU referendum.If it does come that soon, there will be - one predicts - a "genocide of the Cameroons and Osbornites".A stubbornly enduring deficit, a tax credit U-turn, and the sheer numbers of MPs who have chosen to back a leave vote at the referendum have seen Osborne's authority leak.A weekend of melodrama has - in one Tory MP's view - burst the dam.Read more from RossLord Howard played down Mr Duncan Smith's criticisms of government policy - but Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston said they were "very serious"."Today, when David Cameron stands up, he has to reaffirm the message that led many people like myself to join the Conservative Party in the first place when he became leader," she said."Are we about social justice? Are we about spreading the burden fairly? We need to hear that very clear message today."She suggested pensioner benefits - which the Conservatives pledged to protect in their manifesto - should be cut to make up the shortfall.A number of senior Conservative figures have questioned Mr Osborne's credentials to replace David Cameron as prime minister when he steps down.Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell described Mr Osborne's abortive attempt to reform PIP as a "cock-up".He said Mr Osborne was "not the only candidate" for the party leadership and there were a "large number" of alternatives.Influential backbencher David Davis told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire the Â£4bn welfare savings should be cancelled and suggested Mr Osborne should be moved to another department if he wants to be a successful replacement for David Cameron as prime minister.London Mayor Boris Johnson, seen as Mr Osborne's main rival for the top job, is returning from a skiing holiday and has yet to comment.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was understood Mr Cameron had urged Mr Osborne to avoid any major controversy in the Budget so as to avoid fuelling discontent among Tory MPs ahead of the EU referendum.Despite this, our correspondent said, Downing Street insists "the two men remain as close as ever", and have dismissed reports that the prime minister will seek to distance himself from Mr Osborne.Number 10 has stressed that PIP will still have to be reformed in the future as the cost is "unsustainable."Mr Corbyn told the BBC Mr Osborne should be "considering his position"."His Budget simply doesn't add up and it unravelled within hours of him presenting it. This isn't the first time a George Osborne Budget has unravelled," the Labour leader told BBC1's Breakfast programme."It seems to me we need to look at the very heart of this government, at its incompetence, at the way it puts forward proposals that simply don't add up and expects the most needy in our society to take the hit for them."Who would the disability changes impact?
The poverty rate was 15% in 2011, meaning 46.2 million Americans were in poverty, staying flat after three previous years of increases.Real median income of households in the country dropped by 1.5%.The average poverty threshold for a family of four in 2011 was $23,021 (Â£14,300).Income inequality, as measured by the Gini index, increased by 1.6% in 2011, the first time there has been an annual rise in the index since 1993.The percentage of Americans lacking health insurance fell to 15.7% from 16.3%, the report also said.Poverty in the US reached a record high in 2010, at 15.1%.
The attacker, a 27-year-old Swiss man, also died on Sunday, they said.Five other people were hurt when the man set fire to the train and stabbed passengers in the attack on Saturday. Two of them, including a six-year-old child, are in a serious condition.Police have said that, as yet, there is no indication of a political or terrorist motive for the attack.The attack occurred around 14:20 (12:20 GMT) as the train was approaching Salez station, between the towns of Buchs and Sennwald.Several dozen passengers were on board at the time.In a statement (in German), St Gallen cantonal police said video evidence from inside the train showed the attacker, armed with a knife, pouring out a flammable liquid.Six people - including the attacker - were injured. The seventh injured person was a man on the platform who pulled the burning attacker off the train.Forensic experts are analysing the flammable liquid and the scene of the crime.Police said the attacker lived in a canton adjoining St Gallen. His address has been searched.On the basis of the video evidence, police say the man acted alone.
The company says the new overhead compartments will allow passengers to store more hand luggage on its side.The bins will be fitted to some 737 aircraft from the end of this year, the company said.The new design will mean a 2in (5cm) reduction in headspace for passengers, it said, but air vent and light controls will be easier to reach.The loss of headroom may be of some concern to taller passengers, some of whom already struggle with the amount of legroom in economy seating.The new bins can be retrofitted to any of the "Next-Generation" 737s, of which 5,000 are currently in service.Boeing says the balance of the bins has been shifted so they close without the need for a catch or the "bin assist mechanism" currently in use.Travel writer Simon Calder told the BBC: "For the long-suffering passenger, this is mostly good news. By charging for luggage, the low-cost airlines have incentivised us to take everything on board."And guess what? There isn't enough room, so we've had to check in stuff at the gate."So this should help with that problem."Boeing said the bins should speed up boarding and that "passengers will benefit from decreased anxiety about finding space for their carry-on bag when boarding a flight".Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Airlines are the first two operators to place orders for the bins for their 737 fleets.
Agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce said Australia had agreed to health protocols that would be finalised by his Chinese counterpart.This comes after Indonesia slashed live cattle imports from Australia.Mr Joyce said the trade in live cattle between Australia and China could be worth up to $A2bn ($1.5bn, Â£950m) each year.Now that Australia had agreed on the health conditions, farmers could prepare to export cattle once China made the deal official, Mr Joyce said in a statement."I was very pleased today to sign the agreement of health conditions for trade of Australian feeder and slaughter cattle to Chinaâ€”now it's over to my counterpart, Minister Zhi Shuping, to sign on the dotted line and finalise the agreement between our two nations," Mr Joyce said."Over the past five years we've had a significant trade in breeder cattle with China, primarily for dairy heifers."Now, I'm pleased to announce we are a step closer to the commencement in trade in live slaughter and feeder cattle to China," he said.Feeder cattle are those mature enough to be fattened in a feed lot before slaughter.Earlier this month, Australian cattle producers were told Indonesia would only allow 50,000 head of cattle to be imported into the country between July and September, compared with an expected 200,000 permits for that quarter.The Australian Livestock Exporters Council said that decision was both a surprise and a disappointment.The Council's chief executive, Alison Penfold, said the deal with China was a "major breakthrough"."Australia will be the first country to export feeder and slaughter cattle to China," Ms Penfold said in a statement.In recent years, the live cattle industry has been rocked by a series of scandals about poor treatment of the animals in some of the countries Australia exports to.

Anthony Joshua is now taking that challenge, going after the man."Joshua himself asked the question in the build-up to Saturday's fight of whether "Father Time has caught up with the former champ?".But Lewis, who like Joshua won a super-heavyweight Olympic gold medal, says the Ukrainian's age is not the only reason he fancies the British fighter's chances."Now is the perfect time for him," the 51-year-old told BBC Radio 5 live."I believe Joshua is more focused, more aimed. Does he want to be undisputed champion? Absolutely."Media playback is not supported on this device
The Transport for London (TfL) trial follows the success of its "Baby on board" badge for pregnant women.TfL is recruiting 1,000 people to start wearing the blue badges from 12 September.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he hoped they would "give confidence" to people who find standing difficult.Some travellers, such as James McNaught who is joining the trial, had already started making their own badges to alert fellow passengers to their condition.The 45-year-old designed "Cancer on board" badges after travelling on the Tube between Kentish Town and University College Hospital for chemotherapy.Radiotherapy on his throat left him unable to speak to ask for a seat, and the morphine made him appear drunk."I'm really pleased TfL is doing this trial," he said. "A badge and card could help make a real difference to the lives of people undergoing drug treatment or with longer term conditions or disabilities."TfL will use social media and customer information to encourage other passengers to look out for the badges."This small act of consideration from Londoners could make a huge difference to disabled people getting around the city and being fully involved in all London has to offer," said Alice Mitchell-Pye of charity Leonard Cheshire Disability.The six-week trial is believed to be the first of its kind in Europe.
The 21-year-old joined Tigers on loan in February, making five appearances, and is one of four uncapped players in the England squad for the summer Tests.Genge made his senior debut for Bristol in the 2013-14 British and Irish Cup, and scored six tries in 26 appearances."Ellis has made a big impression in his time on loan with us," said Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill."He is a great young prospect and he seems to have found his home at Leicester in his time on loan with us."We hope he continues to build on that first impression and we look forward to seeing his development here."Genge is in the England squad both for Saturday's Test at home to Wales and the June tour of Australia.
The Clogher rider took a narrow victory over compatriot Alastair Seeley after 10 laps, with Dublin's Jack Kennedy fourth and David Allingham in sixth.Seeley is unable to score championship points onhis Spirit Moto2 machine.Farmer now lies second in the standings on 145 points, five behind Tarran Mackenzie, who has taken up Danny Kent's ride in the Moto2 MotoGP series.Allingham is third on 134 points, followed by Carrickfergus rider Andrew Irwin on 115 and Kennedy with 100.The feature Supersport event will take place on Sunday.Be Wiser Ducati pilot Glenn Irwin misses the meeting through injuries sustained in a practice crash at Knockhill but Northern Ireland riders Michael Laverty, Andy Reid and Josh Elliott will take part in Sunday's two Superbike outings.Reid has been called up to replace Davide Giugliano in the Tyco BMW team for the remainder of the season, while Elliott stands in for the injured Christian Iddon for this round.Elliott is also set to take in this weekend's Superstock 1000cc races, along with MD Racing representative Carl Phillips.
The Queen's Park Rangers player made his NI debut in March and scored in his second game against Slovenia.Washington, a postman just four years ago, followed that up with another goal against Belarus on Saturday."The last few months have been a crazy time and I don't think it has sunk in yet. I know I have been fortunate," said the 24-year-old."Football can be about being in the right place at the right time, and I have been lucky."Maybe in a couple of years I will look back and realise how mad it has all been."Washington  combined representing non-League St Ives between 2010 and 2012 with a job delivering mail.Having averaged more than a goal-a-game in his 50 appearances for a club in the ninth tier, he then got his break with Newport who paid £5,000 for him.The Welsh club were promoted to the Football League in his first season, although Washington barely featured.He then moved to Peterborough in 2014 and by mid-January of this year, when QPR took him from London Road, Washington had scored 15 goals and aroused the interest of Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill.Washington had only been to the country once before his international bow against Wales in March but he qualified through the grandparent rule."It was nice to be accepted so quickly and so readily with Northern Ireland," he added."Life doesn't get much better. I'm proud of my achievements and just have to try to enjoy it."
Graeme asks: Now that the EU referendum vote has been declared to leave EU, is it not possible for the government to have a second referendum vote just the same as SNP wants to have another referendum for independence.It is unlikely that there would be a second in-out referendum, not least because there is little evidence it would have a different result.While we should not read too much into the results of polling, in a post-referendum poll by ComRes, 92% of leave voters said they were happy with the outcome, while 4% of remain voters were happy (and, overall, 7% were indifferent).Also, MPs (with a handful of exceptions) have been rushing to say that the result of the vote must be respected.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has suggested there may be a second referendum on the terms of an eventual deal to the leave the EU, although that is not required by current legislation.You can read the full Reality Check here.Neil asks: Can Scotland make a deal with the EU separate to England without leaving the EU?We can't say for sure as this is an unprecedented situation and the treaties do not refer to this set of circumstances.If Scotland were to hold a second referendum, and become independent, it could apply to become a member of the EU in the usual way. And it is now more plausible that EU member states would try to speed up the process for Scotland than it would have been at the time of the 2014 independence referendum.We cannot say if it would be able to keep the UK's membership without going through some sort of application process, but Spain and France have both said they are opposed to holding separate talks with Scotland before the UK leaves the EU, and any deal would require unanimous backing of member states.You can read the full Reality Check here.John asks: Is it not right that the USA has a Trade Agreement with the EU? I am sure that they have not agreed to freedom of movement. So why can we not negotiate a deal like them?The USA does not currently have a free trade deal with the EU. It is in the process of negotiating a trade agreement called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP.The wording and details of the agreement have not been finalised, but it is indeed unlikely that it will include freedom of movement.The EU's deal with Canada has also been cited as a possible starting point for the UK.Both the US and Canada will get access to the single market without actually being part of it, so they will not get full access - Canada's deal, for example, excludes some food items such as eggs and chicken.The UK could negotiate a trade deal with the EU that did not include freedom of movement, but it would be unlikely to provide the same access to the single market that it currently enjoys.You can read the full Reality Check here.Matt says: Much has been made of the two-year exit period that invoking Article 50 will bring. Can anyone explain what might happen if that period expires without agreement on our exit terms? Would our membership simply cease? Or would we remain engaged to all of the terms and conditions that were in place prior to that time?Once Article 50 has been triggered, there is a two-year time limit on negotiations for a new relationship between the UK and the EU.If an agreement has not been approved by other member states and the European Parliament within two years, then the deadline may be extended if all parties agree to it.Otherwise, the UK simply stops being a member of the EU and its treaties will no longer apply.But negotiations on a new relationship could still continue after that point.You can read the full Reality Check here.John asks: How do you know how various ages voted?We will never know the actual figures for how different age groups voted.Like other elections, the referendum was a secret ballot.However, there are post-referendum polls that give a pretty good indication.They can't tell us the precise numbers but they're clear enough to confirm that young voters were more likely to vote Remain, and older voters more likely to vote Leave.You can read more about what polls from before and after the referendum tell us here.Adam asks: If the UK invokes Article 50 by stating its intention to leave, can we later withdraw this intention if, for example, we don't like the deal that is negotiated or will we be compelled to leave?There is nothing in Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, or in any other EU legal document, that would tell us what would happen if an exiting country changed its mind, after the process of leaving had started.A member state leaving the EU is unprecedented, so it's impossible to say what would happen if the UK decided it didn't like the deal and it wanted to stay.However, the signals we have had so far, from both EU and UK politicians, suggest it is unlikely that EU members would allow the UK to change its mind and stay in the EU with all its opt-outs, the rebate and so on, if it didn't like the deal on offer.Graham asks: The view of senior constitutional lawyers is that there has to be a bill passed by Parliament to repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, before Article 50 can be invoked.  Won't MPs be duty-bound to vote in whichever way they consider to be in the best interests of the country?The answer: Some constitutional lawyers think that there will have to be a vote in Parliament before Article 50 is invoked.But others say it's a prerogative power held by the prime minister so no vote is necessary.Even if there is a vote, many MPs will think their primary duty is to uphold the will of the people as expressed in the referendum - even if they had personally supported Remain.Read more: The facts behind claims about our relationship with the EU
Joshua knocked out Wladimir Klitschko to add the WBA world heavyweight title to his IBF crown at Wembley Stadium last weekend.Afterwards the Englishman was hailed as "the biggest sports star in Britain"."Nothing would make us happier than having a Joshua fight at some point," Phillips told BBC Radio Wales Sport.Phillips says the stadium's roof - the only one of its kind in the United Kingdom - ensures the home of Welsh rugby can be used at anytime."The stadium is an asset that we want to use," he continued."When we're not playing rugby on it, we want to use it as much as we can so we've sort of driven that quite hard this year with concerts."Speedway, rugby league, football and boxing have all taken centre stage there and Phillips says talks are continuing with NFL chiefs over the possibility of hosting American Football.Joshua's stunning win over Klitschko added to his appeal and Tyson Fury has accepted the prospect of an all-British title bout.Welsh boxing legend Joe Calzaghe beat Mikkel Kessler in front of an estimated 50,000 fans at what was then named Millennium Stadium in November, 2007Phillips, the joint stadium and Welsh Rugby Union chief executive, added: "We're in conversations with various boxing promoters.Find out how to get into boxing with our special guide."Obviously the roof - we are the only big stadium with a roof - and it's been done before, obviously, with Calzaghe and so on, previously."So nothing would make us happier than having a Joshua fight at some point."Get all the latest boxing news sent straight to your device with notifications in the BBC Sport app. Find out more here.
The search giant's all-important advertising revenue was also up 11%, to $16bn.In a statement Google's finance chief Ruth Porat highlighted ad growth on mobile and YouTube.Google's shares jumped 7.5% in after-market trading as traders welcomed the better-than-expected results.The share price had already risen 3.5% during normal trading hours.Advertisers pay Google only if a user clicks on one of their ads. "Cost per click", or the average price of online ads, fell in the quarter, but was more than offset by the increase in ad volumes.Google's ad revenue has been under pressure as consumers access its services on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, whose advertising rates tend to be lower.Google's share price rise "is reflecting the fact that they've effectively just beat earnings for the first time in several quarters," said Victor Anthony, an analyst at Axiom Capital.
Mothers-to-be are more likely to get malaria as their immunity is lowered, says the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG).Malaria carries serious risks for mother and baby including miscarriage, stillbirth and premature labour.The tropical disease is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes a fever, flu-like symptoms, vomiting and diarrhoea.There have been no malaria-related deaths in pregnant or recently pregnant women in the UK in the past decade but the RCOG says it has been receiving inquires from worried women.In the UK, about 1,500 cases of malaria are reported each year and about 10 people will die, said the RCOG.It says all non-essential trips to areas with a high risk of malaria should be avoided.Risk areas include large areas of Africa, Asia including China and India, Central and South America, parts of the Middle East and some Pacific Islands.If the trip is unavoidable, the college advises women to seek advice from a centre with expertise in malaria which will provide information on ways to reduce the risk of infection.Women should make sure they are aware of the risk, take out measures such as mosquito nets for bite prevention and take anti-malarial medication.Philippa Marsden, who chairs the RCOG's patient information committee, said although the risks were still relatively small it was important that women were well-informed.Cath Broderick of the RCOG women's network said: "If women are worried about symptoms after returning from a high-risk country and think they may have malaria, they should see a doctor immediately and inform them of their recent travels."Symptoms can take a week or more to develop after being bitten.
Special Report: The Technology of BusinessKenya's mobile money revolutionAfrica mobile boom powers innovationIs tech saving the music industry?Business travel in hi-tech faceliftCan tech combat modern slavery?Battery technology playing catch-upSuch digital technologies offer the potential to tackle some of the continent's chronic education challenges, including overcrowded classrooms, teacher shortages and the 30 million children in sub-Saharan Africa without any education at all.As Africa becomes ever more connected, educators and publishers are finding new ways to reach young audiences and develop their burgeoning minds.One such company is Via Afrika Publishers.First and foremost a publisher of textbooks for over 65 years, Via Afrika began to investigate the move to digital content several years ago. Its early adoption seems to be reaping dividends."We decided about three years ago, after looking at what was taking place in the world, that e-learning was an important direction to go in," says Michael Goodman, the company's group content manager."We decided to design a set of e-learning books that matched our printed books and indeed matched the books we submitted to the education department. It was a sort of 'build it and they will come' mentality, because there was no call for any electronic books to be submitted," he added.Mr Goodman points out that uptake has really mushroomed over the past year. While there were about 1,000 e-book sales in 2013, there have already been 64,000 in 2014, he says.But he admits that as the South African government has invested heavily in printed materials, a widespread shift towards e-learning will require partnerships between private enterprise and government."We are seeing pockets of co-operation," he says. "Companies are coming up with their own initiatives in supplying tablets and then co-operating with government to implement them in schools."That needs to grow a whole lot. We feel that a very strong public and private partnership is needed to move us towards e-learning completely."Via Afrika has formed just such a partnership with a non-profit organisation, Breadline Africa, to provide rural communities with digital education centres.Breadline Africa is a Cape Town-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) that specialises in converting old shipping containers for community use.The digital centres are being developed inside existing libraries and each is supplied with 15 Android tablet devices loaded with Via Afrika's latest educational programmes, apps and electronic textbooks.The Via Afrika Digital Education Centre initiative is currently being rolled out in three primary schools in the provinces of Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and the Free State."I visited one school last week in Limpopo and to see how the kids have responded so positively in working with brand new media has been remarkable," says Mr Goodman."It's going to be interesting for us to see what the impact will be in a small rural school."One of the challenges is educating the teachers as well as the children. So the centres will receive regular visits and updates to keep the educators aware of the latest developments, says Mr Goodman.Look around one of these centres and you will see people consuming content and interacting online in a variety of social networking spaces.One such space is social learning platform Obami.com. The Cape Town-based firm is making waves with its brand of educational tools and online connections.Founded by Barbara Mallinson in 2007, Obami - which means "my" or "mine" in isiZulu - began as a generic social networking site.But Ms Mallinson soon saw the opportunity to refine the concept and have an impact upon a key issue in South Africa - education."We are all very aware of the education crisis going on in South Africa and beyond. Social media was being used in entertainment and for business but no-one was really doing this in education," she explains.Ms Mallinson and the Obami team wanted to see how social media in schools could be used to connect scholars, teachers and parents.The first pilot study "went wonderfully", she says, although the teachers remained wary of social networking for social networking's sake."We looked at it again and thought social networking is very useful in many industries but it has to serve a purpose, and so we decided to change a few things and ended up with this idea of social media being applied to a learning management system."This means uploading and sharing content, and setting and undertaking assignments, she explains. Sharing curriculum content online and monitoring learners through assessment were core principles "bringing the platform to life".Over the past few years, Obami has continued to grow across South Africa and the continent with about 400 schools and organisations now using the platform to connect learners and partners.As the platform is customisable it is equally suitable for an early stage learner as for an adult involved in distance learning, the company believes. It is accessible via PC, tablet or phone."Obami was traditionally a primary and secondary platform but we have now opened it up beyond schools," she says."We also found a demand from scholars whose schools weren't using the platform to get on to Obami, so we started our own school of sorts and now have nearly 4,000 individuals on the platform who can access its learning capabilities and content."Few believe technology for its own sake will be the knight in shining armour that helps South Africa and the continent educate its youth more effectively.But used strategically by educators, publishers and government working in partnership, it has the potential to achieve great things. And fast.
The Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS) study found 15% of people said it happened "most of the time" or "always".Nearly a quarter (23%) had gone without food at least once in the previous year.CAS said its findings showed that debt was "just a fact of life" for most people.Almost half (48%) of the 1,501 Scots who took part in the survey had been forced to borrow money or use credit to buy food.A fifth needed help to pay their rent or mortgage - a figure which jumped to 29% when it came to utility bills.The report also found that more than half (55%) of the people quizzed would be unable to pay a sudden bill of Â£100 without borrowing, using savings or cutting back on essentials.For a Â£250 bill, this rose to 69%, and for Â£1,000 it was 83%.Nearly four in 10 (38%) felt they were "living comfortably" on their income.CAS policy manager Keith Dryburgh said the study showed that debt was not just an issue for people on low incomes.He said: "Many working Scots on reasonable salaries occasionally need to borrow money to get them from one pay day to the next."While many of these people would not regard this as a crisis situation, our research also finds that many people are vulnerable to financial shocks, like being unable to pay a sudden bill without getting into debt or using savings."More than half of Scots are not familiar with their rights as debt consumers."Given that debt is so pervasive in Scotland, we are keen to make sure that people know their rights in relation to debt and also know what options they have if they want to manage their finances better."
The Taliban has already captured a few of the 14 districts of Helmand, which borders Pakistan. According to some estimates, the insurgent group now controls more than half of the province, which produces the bulk of Afghanistan's lucrative opium crop.Reports say that the Afghan security forces pulled out overnight from the district headquarters and the main bazaar, after the Taliban launched a major attack.The Taliban insurgents had been trying to capture the Sangin headquarters for two years.The Afghan soldiers and police who had been fighting hard to repel the repeated attacks by Taliban fighters, at times complained about not receiving reinforcements and being short of ammunition and food.The fall of Sangin, one of the most heavily-populated districts in Helmand, also indicates the Taliban's growing strength in the south, and has a symbolic significance for the US-Nato led mission in Afghanistan.Sangin district was perhaps the most dangerous and deadliest for all sides involved in the war in Afghanistan.Both the US and UK lost more soldiers in Sangin than in any of around 400 other districts in Afghanistan.Of the 456 British lives lost in Afghanistan since 2001, most of them - more than 100 - were killed in Sangin over a period of four years.British forces were deployed in Helmand province in 2006 to secure it and prepare the ground for good governance and reconstruction.Although some progress was made by the more than 10,000 British troops based there, the fighting soon intensified, resulting in the death of many Afghan and British forces as well as civilians.By 2009, the then Afghan president Hamid Karzai and American officials expressed dissatisfaction with the British performance.In 2010, thousands of US Marines were deployed to replace British troops and responsibility for security was transferred from the UK to the US in several areas of Helmand, including Sangin, Nawa, Garmsir, Marjah, Khanshin and Nawzad.Within the first 90 days of their deployment, around 20 US Marines were killed in Sangin.Since responsibility for security was handed over from international forces to the Afghan government in 2014, hundreds of Afghan forces have lost their lives defending Sangin.The fight to capture Sangin also took the lives of more Taliban fighters than any other battle for territory in Afghanistan.Afghan forces say they have made a tactical retreat from the centre of Sangin, which has been fiercely fought over for more than a decade.The Taliban's capture of Sangin will also have a destabilising effect on neighbouring Kandahar, a province of huge strategic and political significance, and whose capital is Afghanistan's second-largest town.The fall of Sangin is an indication that this year's fighting season might be even tougher as the group is planning to push even harder to expand its footprint throughout the country.The Taliban now controls more territory than at any point since the US-led invasion in 2001 which toppled its regime.The loss of Sangin underlines the challenge facing the Afghan government and its Western allies, who, according to US military officials are in a "stalemate" with the Taliban.The new US President Donald Trump has yet to announce his Afghanistan strategy, but it is likely to involve sending a few thousand more troops to help the approximately 13,000 personnel from Nato allies and partner countries currently based in the country.There are two possibilities now.The Afghan forces, with the help of US Special Forces and aerial bombing, might try to recapture the district as seen in some other parts of the country.Or the government will leave it to the Taliban, as they have done in a few other districts in Helmand, and focus on defending Lashkar Gah.
A former Spanish colony, it was annexed by Morocco in 1975. Since then it has been the subject of a long-running territorial dispute between Morocco and its indigenous Saharawi people, led by the Polisario Front.A 16-year-long insurgency ended with a UN-brokered truce in 1991 and the promise of a referendum on independence which has yet to take place.Although under the de facto administrative control of Morocco, the status and sovereignty of Western Sahara remain unresolved and numerous direct talks have failed to break the political deadlock.The Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), declared by the Polisario Front in 1976, is now recognised by many governments and is a full member of the African Union.Home to phosphate reserves and rich fishing grounds off its coast, Western Sahara is also believed to have as yet untapped offshore oil deposits.Population 567,000Main town  LaayouneArea 252,120 sq km (97,344 sq miles)Main language ArabicMain religion IslamLife expectancy 66 years (men), 70 years (women)President of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic: Brahim GhaliThe Polisario Front proclaimed the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in 1976, with a government in exile in Algeria.Brahim Ghali was elected leader of the Polisario Front and president of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in July 2016 following the death of long-term president Mohamed Abdelaziz Ezzedine.A seasoned military leader, described both as a "hard-line supporter" and "historic figure", he was one of Polisario's founding members in 1973 and led the first raids against the occupying Spanish forces that sparked the armed struggle for Western Saharan independence.In 2008 he left his post as ambassador to Spain with unresolved charges against him alleging inhumane treatment and the torture of Saharan prisoners, and became the ambassador to Algeria.Morocco's state broadcaster RTM operates radio and TV services from Laayoune.On the other side of the political divide, a Polisario-backed mediumwave (AM) radio station is on the air.RadioTelevisionNews agencySome key dates in the history of Western Sahara:1884 - Spain colonises Western Sahara, an area formerly populated by Berber tribes.1934 - Becomes a Spanish province known as Spanish Sahara.1957 - Newly-independent Morocco lays centuries-old claim to Western Sahara.1965 - The UN calls for the decolonisation of Western Sahara.1973 - Polisario Front, the indigenous Saharawi independence movement, is founded.1975 - Morocco's King Hassan defies a Hague ruling in favour of Saharawi rights to self-determination and stages the "Green March" of 350,000 Moroccans into Western Sahara.

Bailey, 16, was stabbed during a fight with a fellow pupil at Cults Academy.The schoolboy's killer is serving nine years for culpable homicide.The review, conducted by child welfare professional Andrew Lowe, made 21 recommendations last October. Mr Swinney will give a statement on Tuesday.The review found the pupil's death was "potentially avoidable".
There is an armed police presence at the Donington Park rock music festival in Leicestershire in the wake of the London and Manchester terror attacks.Senior officers have been encouraging fans to still engage with police and are using the hashtag "copaselfie".Thousands of fans watched American metal band System of a Down end the first day of the festival on Friday.A spokesman for Leicestershire Police said posing for selfies with armed officers was "safe" and they have had an "amazingly positive response" from the public.Supt Martyn Ball, from Leicestershire Police, said on Thursday that armed police would help make people feel "safe and secure" following the recent attacks.He added that some parents had been in touch saying their children were considering not going unless there were armed officers.However, he said this would not change the way the force interacted with revellers.Downloadcops, which post messages to help fans at the festival, tweeted: "@PRTLeicsSgt with a gentleman that just gave us a wonderful poetry rendition. Sgt Waft is now taking on the night shift. Enjoy."Leicester City Cops also tweeted: "Hello from the cops at #DL2017, please don't hesitate to come over, say hello! #copaselfie with us! ðŸ˜ˆ #Download".About 80,000 people are expected at Download over the weekend.The festival, held at Donington Park in Leicestershire since 2003, has hosted some of the biggest names in rock including Iron Maiden and MotÃ¶rhead.Organiser Andy Copping said Download was the "biggest" of its type in the world.He told The Beat programme, broadcast on BBC Local Radio, that Download was also the "friendliest".Biffy Clyro are headlining the main stage on Saturday night and Aerosmith, who are said to be performing for the last time in the UK, are the top act on Sunday.
Research suggest animals that build their nests in early spring may win the fight for available habitat at the expense of late breeders.Conservation efforts should focus on ensuring rare species have enough places to nest, say scientists.For example, areas could be left to grow wild between spring and summer to help bumblebees establish nests.Habitats such as hedgerows and hay meadows are being lost in many countries, meaning that fewer nesting sites are available.Competition among animals for a suitable place to nest could explain why some species are struggling to survive."Ecologists understand why some groups of species are declining more, such as why farmland species are declining more than woodland species," said Dr Andrew Higginson of the University of Exeter."But an enduring mystery is the big variation in the declines of closely related species. Fighting over nest sites may be part of the reason - when nest sites are hard to come by, the species that will suffer most are those that nest later in the year."The University of Exeter study analysed population changes in more than 200 bird species and 40 bumblebee species around the world.The population data was combined with a mathematical model that used game theory to predict the likely behaviour of bees and birds when faced with competition for nesting sites.It calculated the implications of fighting for nesting sites, based on the size of each species, the time of nesting and the quality of the nesting site.The study found larger species that nest early generally do better, while smaller bees and birds that nest later in the year lose out in the struggle for habitat.For example, the chaffinch is doing well in the UK, while the goldfinch is on the decline."We need to have a more holistic approach to providing good habitat for animals," Dr Higginson told BBC News. "We need to worry about the whole life cycle not just what they eat."He said conservation efforts for animals such as birds and bees tend to focus on providing food.Restoration and provision of nest sites should be an urgent priority, he said.This could be as simple as waiting to cut hedgerows until later in the year when all animals have nested or providing more boxes for birds to nest in.The research is published in the journal, Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology.Follow Helen on  Twitter.
The idea of the UK paying for tariff-free access to the EU's internal market has been mooted in recent days.The foreign secretary told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the question of whether the UK would pay anything at all was "pure speculation", but if it did, any payments had to be "sensible".Critics say leaving the single market would be an "act of self-harm".Former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said remaining in the single market of 500 million customers was the "least economically disruptive form of Brexit", and, in return for this, the UK should be granted powers for an "emergency brake" on migration from the EU.Negotiations on the terms of exit from the EU will not officially begin until the UK begins the Article 50 process - which Theresa May has said will happen by the end of March.Pressed on suggestions by his cabinet colleague, the Brexit secretary David Davis, that the UK could pay for tariff-free access to the single market, Mr Johnson - who was a prominent Leave campaigner - said he was not "going to get into the minutiae" before negotiations began.Analysis by Ellie Price, BBC political correspondentHe talked a lot in the EU referendum campaign about taking back control. Now Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is keen to show he hasn't changed his tune.But he seems to be singing from a slightly different song sheet to that his cabinet colleague, Brexit Secretary David Davis. On Thursday, Mr Davis suggested the government would consider paying the EU to maintain access to the single market.Boris Johnson said no decision had been taken, and he seemed to favour more limited payments to the EU, including student exchanges and research programmes.Labour say Britain's membership of the single market is crucial and will define the difference between a so-called hard or soft Brexit."That is something that obviously David Davis is considering. It doesn't mean that a decision has been taken," he said.The EU, he insisted, wanted a "partnership" with the UK and that would involve a degree of mutual co-operation, for instance the UK continuing to partly funding the Erasmus education exchange scheme.But he hinted that this would not extend to actually paying to get access to the single market without any penalties or extra levies."I have given you an indication of the kind of payments that I think might be sensible," he told Andrew Marr."My own view is that I see no reason why those payments should be large. And I do see a big opportunity for us to spend the money we are getting back on other priorities."The government has yet to set out its negotiating objectives in detail but ministers are coming under growing pressure to avoid a so-called "hard Brexit" - a term coined by Remain supporters to describe what they say would be the impact of the UK giving up its membership of the single marketBrexit supporters say continued membership of the single market is only possible if the UK continues to accept rules on the free movement of EU citizens and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice - which they say is unacceptable.Mr Johnson said Brexit presented the chance to "take back control of our borders, to take back control of quite large sums of money, not to be run by the European Court - so not to have EU law in this country, and fourthly... to be able to do free trade deals".The EU is under pressure in many quarters to drive a hard bargain with the UK but Mr Johnson dismissed suggestions the UK would be punished for voting out."It may get pretty hairy at times and there may be some difficult bits, but beneath it all there is a massive fondness for the UK and a desire to do the best possible deal."And in a separate interview with ITV's Peston on Sunday, he said foreign students should not be included in the official migration statistics - a view that contradicts current government policy.Labour's shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said the choice was between an "isolated, hard Brexit and a collaborative, co-operative Brexit" and while Labour would not stand in the way of triggering Article 50, he said it would oppose a deal which resulted in an "arms-length" relationship with the single market.Mr Clegg, now Lib Dem EU spokesman, told the BBC's Sunday Politics he would oppose Brexit unless single market membership and a referendum on the final deal were guaranteed.
The victim was killed on Wednesday about a mile from a West Glacier campground.The authorities say armed police officers are searching for the bear but gave no further details.Bear attacks are rare in the area with only 10 deaths reported since the park was created in 1910.The dead cyclist was a 38-year-old officer with the US Forest Service, Flathead County Sheriff Chuck Curry told Daily Inter Lake.com.Officials say the grizzly confronted two cyclists on a trail after they disturbed it.The dead rider was taken off his saddle by the bear and the other rode off to get help.The US Fish and Wildlife Service recently announced plans to remove grizzly bears from the threatened species list.Who, What, Why: What should you do if you encounter a bear?

Labour MP Keith Vaz said Coca-Cola was marketing a "real health hazard".But Conservative city councillor Ross Grant told the Leicester Mercury that opening the sweet shop in 2013 "put him into the hypocrite category".Keith Vaz has not responded, but previously said he opposed the way Coke is promoted, rather than the product."What we want to do is to make sure Coca-Cola indulges in a proper debate and has a proper engagement with health campaigners, such as Members of Parliament who are part of the All Party Diabetes Group, to make sure that they are much more responsible in the way in which they promote and sell their products," said the Leicester MP.Public Health England also has concerns about the marketing of Coca-Cola.Its chief nutritionist, Dr Alison Tedstone, said: "The evidence shows that this type of advertising increases children's preference for and consumption of sugary drinks, which are linked to tooth decay and too many calories leading to obesity."Worryingly, children and teenagers are having three times more sugar than the maximum recommended amount and the biggest source is sugary drinks."Public Health England said evidence showed that restrictions on marketing, advertising and promotion of high-sugar products are likely to be more effective than adding a tax to sugary drinks, along with reducing the added sugar in processed foods and drinks.Dr Tedstone said: "There is no place for sugary drinks in a child's daily diet - lower fat milks and water are ideal but swapping to no added sugar, diet and sugar free alternatives is fine."35gsugar in a 330ml can of Coca-Cola53gsugar in a 500ml bottle of Coca-Cola19g advised maximum sugar intake per day for children aged 4 to 624g maximum daily sugar intake for children aged 7 to 1030g maximum sugar intake for adults and children over 11Coca-Cola Great Britain said its Christmas truck would offer two sugar-free variants."We're delighted to be visiting Leicester this year as part of the Coca-Cola Christmas truck tour," it said in a statement."Our Christmas truck tour also operates in line with our responsible marketing policy so we don't sample our drinks directly to under-12s."Mr Vaz was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 13 years ago at a health awareness event in his constituency.
"I'm OK with myself, I sleep pretty good at night," Casey Anthony told the Associated Press, adding that she does not care "what anyone thinks about me".The 30-year-old complained about her portrayal in the media as a partying child-killer.Anthony was convicted of lying to police but acquitted of murder.Casey Anthony: The case that gripped the USIf found guilty she could have faced the death penalty under Florida law."My sentence was doled out long before there was a verdict. Sentence first, verdict afterward," she said."People found me guilty long before I had my day in court."The 2011 case drew millions of viewers across the US, with every twist covered on live television.Anthony was dubbed "America's most hated mom" amid reports she went to nightclubs and got a tattoo in the month her daughter was missing.Last week the former judge that presided over the case spoke out to say that Anthony "more than likely" accidently killed her daughter by using too much chloroform to calm her before suffocating her with duct tape.During the trial, her defence argued that the girl drowned in the pool, and that Anthony and her father covered it up.The government failed to secure a conviction due to the lack of physical evidence tying her to Caylee's death.When asked about the drowning defence, Anthony hesitated."Everyone has their theories, I don't know. As I stand here today I can't tell you one way or another."The last time I saw my daughter I believed she was alive and was going to be OK, and that's what was told to me."She added: "Caylee would be 12 right now. And would be a total badass."
Dr Barry Morgan said the Wales Bill, passed last week after a vote of approval by AMs, was unjust.He added that Scotland and Northern Ireland were offered "better deals".Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns has previously said it meant people in Wales would get more say over "everyday decisions in their lives".Dr Morgan is due to retire after 14 years leading the Church in Wales.The Wales Bill offers to extend the transfer of powers over tax, energy, transport and the assembly's own affairs but there have been claims it would reduce AMs law-making powersDr Morgan told the BBC's Newyddion9 programme: "Devolution in Wales is a matter of equality and fairness and we have not reached that point yet, as far as Wales is in the question in my opinion."Asked if devolution needed to go further and faster, he said: "Of course. And I don't believe the latest bill which was passed is a just settlement."But, on the other hand, this is the only thing we'll be given at the moment."In 20 years we have reached a very good point. We now have a government which is responsible for a number of things in Wales and it's much better than having a Welsh secretary and two ministers controlling Wales."That is much better but it has not gone as far as it should, because Scotland and Northern Ireland have been given better deals than Wales."Dr Morgan, who is retiring on Tuesday, has supported numerous causes while at the helm of the church, including more powers for the Welsh Assembly.
The pledges are included in the party's five-year plan for government.Increased free child care and more apprenticeships are promised, along with an M4 relief road and a South Wales Metro public transport network.Plaid Cymru said the programme was "lacklustre", while the Conservatives said Labour had let Wales down.The most expensive commitments cover 30 hours of free childcare a week over 48 weeks for parents of three and four-year-olds, and 100,000 apprenticeships open to people of all ages.The programme covers what the Welsh Government will try to achieve, while the first indication of what will be cut will emerge when its draft budget is published in October.The main pledges include:A Welsh Government source said there had been a "full and frank assessment of every pound, shilling and pence that we spend" in light of the financial uncertainty surrounding Brexit.He added: "Some tough decisions will have to be made in the first year."Salami slicing is not going to get the job done this time round. There will be areas and programmes that will be cut."Responding to the claims on BBC Radio Wales, the first minister said: "There are going to be cuts... I'm not going to pretend otherwise."Of course, our budget is shrinking, it has been for many years and that means very difficult decisions have to be taken."We are going to have to look at some of the schemes we have delivered for many, many years and make a judgement."A programme, called Taking Wales Forward, reflects many of the pledges outlined in Labour's manifesto for the Welsh Assembly election in May.Mr Jones said Labour would see through its election promises, including building an M4 relief road and a South Wales Metro.He said: "The UK's withdrawal from the European Union creates some uncertainty and challenges, but our mandate is clear."The Welsh Government's relentless focus will be on driving improvement in our economy and public services, which are together the bedrock of people's daily lives.On local government reform, Mr Jones said many services would have to be delivered "on a wider basis" in future, but he would not say whether this meant council mergers were still on the cards.Plaid Cymru AM Rhun ap Iorwerth said the programme for government portrayed the "gulf" between the two parties.That was despite pledges that were part of a deal struck in return for allowing Carwyn Jones to be re-elected as first minister back in May."It should come as no surprise that a lacklustre manifesto has led to a lacklustre programme for government," said Mr ap Iorwerth."Yes, it's good to see the elements that Plaid Cymru drove through in our post-election one-off agreement, including a pledge to create 100,000 new apprenticeships and a new drugs and treatments fund, but Labour's lack of innovative ideas shines through again."As the official opposition in the assembly, Plaid said it would be "challenging Labour to do better".The Conservatives said it was "difficult to disagree" with the plans but said Labour had "let Wales down" since devolution.Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: "As usual we are left with little by way of detail, and Carwyn Jones's claim that Wales is punching above its weight is delusional."In spite of our many and varied talents, the evidence suggests that the exact opposite is true."Under Labour, the Welsh education system ranks behind Vietnam; large swathes of Wales are poorer than parts of Bulgaria, Romania and Poland; and Welsh NHS waiting times are the longest in the UK."If the Labour Party thinks that Wales punching above its weight, then they have a very low opinion of our country indeed."Janet Jones, Wales policy chair for the Federation of Small Businesses, said: "We welcome the commitment in the Programme for Government to supporting innovation and providing additional support for businesses."Key to that commitment must be a new economic development strategy which meets the challenges facing the Welsh economy in the coming five years."That strategy needs to contain fresh thinking and should place a focus on growing small firms into the successful and grounded medium-sized businesses that Wales needs to put our economy on a stronger footing."Brexit will cast uncertainty over the next five years, says Carwyn Jones.But as someone who campaigned for a Remain vote, he is bound to talk up the risks - as he sees them - of leaving the EU.Whatever comes from Brexit, we know for certain there are plenty of hurdles that will make life difficult for Mr Jones if he is to deliver this five-year programme.Labour has no majority in the Senedd. Today's statement is a chance for him to explain how he will make Labour's manifesto a reality. But in doing so, he must keep other parties on side to maintain his grip on power.And we know there will be growing pressure on the Welsh Government budget. More cuts loom and sources close to the first minister say they have already had to wield the axe to raise the funds necessary to pay for expensive manifesto pledges.
Wandsworth inmate Neil Moore was on remand when he used an illicit mobile phone to create a fake email account.He posed as a senior court clerk and sent bail instructions to prison staff, who released him on 10 March 2014.His deception was uncovered when solicitors went to interview him three days later, only to find him gone.Moore, 28, from Ilford, east London, handed himself in three days later.Southwark Crown Court heard he had set up a fake web domain which closely resembled that of the court service's official address.He then emailed the prison's custody inbox with instructions for his release.The court heard Moore registered the bogus website in the name of investigating officer Det Insp Chris Soole, giving the address and contact details for the Royal Courts of Justice.Prosecutor Ian Paton said: "A lot of criminal ingenuity harbours in the mind of Mr Moore. The case is one of extraordinary criminal inventiveness, deviousness and creativity, all apparently the developed expertise of this defendant".The judge, Recorder David Hunt QC, described the behaviour as "ingenious" criminality.Moore had previously used four different aliases to commit fraud worth Â£1,819,000 in total.Posing as staff from Barclays Bank, Lloyds Bank, and Santander he managed to persuade large organisations to give him vast sums of money.Sometimes he answered calls from victims using a man's voice and then pretended to transfer the call to a colleague before resuming the conversation in a woman's voice, the court heard earlier.He was so convincing police initially co-charged his partner Kristen Moore with the deception. All charges against her have now been dropped.Moore, who has pleaded guilty to eight counts of fraud and one count of escape from lawful custody, will be sentenced on 20 April.
